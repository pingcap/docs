# Deploy TiDB Using Ansible

This guide describes how to deploy a TiDB cluster using Ansible. For the production environment, it is recommended to deploy TiDB using Ansible.

## Overview

Ansible is an IT automation tool that can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks such as continuous deployments or zero downtime rolling updates.

[TiDB-Ansible](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-ansible) is a TiDB cluster deployment tool developed by PingCAP, based on Ansible playbook. TiDB-Ansible enables you to quickly deploy a new TiDB cluster which includes PD, TiDB, TiKV, and the cluster monitoring modules.

You can use the TiDB-Ansible configuration file to set up the cluster topology and complete all the following operation tasks:

- Initialize operating system parameters
- Deploy the whole TiDB cluster
- [Start the TiDB cluster](ansible-operation.md#start-a-cluster)
- [Stop the TiDB cluster](ansible-operation.md#stop-a-cluster)
- [Modify component configuration](ansible-deployment-rolling-update.md#modify-component-configuration)
- [Scale the TiDB cluster](ansible-deployment-scale.md)
- [Upgrade the component version](ansible-deployment-rolling-update.md#upgrade-the-component-version)
- [Clean up data of the TiDB cluster](ansible-operation.md#clean-up-cluster-data)
- [Destroy the TiDB cluster](ansible-operation.md#destroy-a-cluster)

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

1. Several target machines that meet the following requirements:

    - 4 or more machines
    
        A standard TiDB cluster contains 6 machines. You can use 4 machines for testing.

    - CentOS 7.3 (64 bit) or later, x86_64 architecture (AMD64)
    - Network between machines

    > **Note:** When you deploy TiDB using Ansible, **use SSD disks for the data directory of TiKV and PD nodes**. Otherwise, it cannot pass the check. If you only want to try TiDB out and explore the features, it is recommended to [deploy TiDB using Docker Compose](docker-compose.md) on a single machine.

2. A Control Machine that meets the following requirements:

    > **Note:** The Control Machine can be one of the target machines.

    - CentOS 7.3 (64 bit) or later with Python 2.7 installed
    - Access to the Internet

## Step 1: Install system dependencies on the Control Machine

Log in to the Control Machine using the `root` user account, and run the corresponding command according to your operating system.

- If you use a Control Machine installed with CentOS 7, run the following command:

    ```
    # yum -y install epel-release git curl sshpass
    # yum -y install python-pip
    ```

- If you use a Control Machine installed with Ubuntu, run the following command:

    ```
    # apt-get -y install git curl sshpass python-pip
    ```

## Step 2: Create the `tidb` user on the Control Machine and generate the SSH key

Make sure you have logged in to the Control Machine using the `root` user account, and then run the following command.

1. Create the `tidb` user.

    ```
    # useradd tidb
    ```

2. Set a password for the `tidb` user account.

    ```
    # passwd tidb
    ```

3. Configure sudo without password for the `tidb` user account by adding `tidb ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` to the end of the sudo file:

    ```
    # visudo
    tidb ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
    ```
4. Generate the SSH key.

    Execute the `su` command to switch the user from `root` to `tidb`. Create the SSH key for the `tidb` user account and hit the Enter key when `Enter passphrase` is prompted. After successful execution, the SSH private key file is `/home/tidb/.ssh/id_rsa`, and the SSH public key file is `/home/tidb/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.

    ```
    # su - tidb
    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/home/tidb/.ssh/id_rsa):
    Created directory '/home/tidb/.ssh'.
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    Enter same passphrase again:
    Your identification has been saved in /home/tidb/.ssh/id_rsa.
    Your public key has been saved in /home/tidb/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
    The key fingerprint is:
    SHA256:eIBykszR1KyECA/h0d7PRKz4fhAeli7IrVphhte7/So tidb@172.16.10.49
    The key's randomart image is:
    +---[RSA 2048]----+
    |=+o+.o.          |
    |o=o+o.oo         |
    | .O.=.=          |
    | . B.B +         |
    |o B * B S        |
    | * + * +         |
    |  o + .          |
    | o  E+ .         |
    |o   ..+o.        |
    +----[SHA256]-----+
    ```

## Step 3: Download TiDB-Ansible to the Control Machine

1. Log in to the Control Machine using the `tidb` user account and enter the `/home/tidb` directory.

2. Download the corresponding TiDB-Ansible version from the [TiDB-Ansible project](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-ansible). The default folder name is `tidb-ansible`.

    - Download the 2.0 GA version:

        ```bash
        $ git clone -b release-2.0 https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-ansible.git
        ```
    
    - Download the master version:

        ```bash
        $ git clone https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-ansible.git
        ```

    > **Note:** It is required to download `tidb-ansible` to the `/home/tidb` directory using the `tidb` user account. If you download it to the `/root` directory, a privilege issue occurs.

    If you have questions regarding which version to use, email to info@pingcap.com for more information or [file an issue](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-ansible/issues/new).

## Step 4: Install Ansible and its dependencies on the Control Machine

Make sure you have logged in to the Control Machine using the `tidb` user account.

It is required to use `pip` to install Ansible and its dependencies, otherwise a compatibility issue occurs. Currently, the TiDB 2.0 GA version and the master version are compatible with Ansible 2.4 and Ansible 2.5.

1. Install Ansible and the dependencies on the Control Machine:

    ```bash
    $ cd /home/tidb/tidb-ansible
    $ sudo pip install -r ./requirements.txt
    ```

    Ansible and the related dependencies are in the `tidb-ansible/requirements.txt` file.

2. View the version of Ansible:

    ```bash
    $ ansible --version
    ansible 2.5.0
    ```

## Step 5: Configure the SSH mutual trust and sudo rules on the Control Machine

Make sure you have logged in to the Control Machine using the `tidb` user account.

1. Add the IPs of your target machines to the `[servers]` section of the `hosts.ini` file.

    ```bash
    $ cd /home/tidb/tidb-ansible
    $ vi hosts.ini
    [servers]
    192.168.0.2
    192.168.0.3
    192.168.0.4
    192.168.0.5
    192.168.0.6
    192.168.0.7
    192.168.0.8
    192.168.0.10

    [all:vars]
    username = tidb
    ntp_server = pool.ntp.org
    ```

2. Run the following command and input the `root` user account password of your target machines.

    ```bash
    $ ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini create_users.yml -u root -k
    ```

    This step creates the `tidb` user account on the target machines, configures the sudo rules and the SSH mutual trust between the Control Machine and the target machines.

> To configure the SSH mutual trust and sudo without password manually, see [How to manually configure the SSH mutual trust and sudo without password](#how-to-manually-configure-the-ssh-mutual-trust-and-sudo-without-password)

## Step 6: Install the NTP service on the target machines

> **Note:** If the time and time zone of all your target machines are same, the NTP service is on and is normally synchronizing time, you can ignore this step. See [How to check whether the NTP service is normal](#how-to-check-whether-the-ntp-service-is-normal).

Make sure you have logged in to the Control Machine using the `tidb` user account, run the following command:

```bash
$ cd /home/tidb/tidb-ansible
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini deploy_ntp.yml -u tidb -b
```

The NTP service is installed and started using the software repository that comes with the system on the target machines. The default NTP server list in the installation package is used. The related `server` parameter is in the `/etc/ntp.conf` configuration file.

To make the NTP service start synchronizing as soon as possible, the system executes the `ntpdate` command to set the local date and time by polling `ntp_server` in the `hosts.ini` file. The default server is `pool.ntp.org`, and you can also replace it with your NTP server.

## Step 7: Configure the CPUfreq governor mode on the target machine

For details about CPUfreq, see [the CPUfreq Governor documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/power_management_guide/cpufreq_governors).

Set the CPUfreq governor mode to `performance` to make full use of CPU performance.

### Check the governor modes supported by the system

You can run the `cpupower frequency-info --governors` command to check the governor modes which the system supports:

```
# cpupower frequency-info --governors
analyzing CPU 0:
  available cpufreq governors: performance powersave
```

Taking the above code for example, the system supports the `performance` and `powersave` modes. 

> **Note:** As the following shows, if it returns “Not Available”, it means that the current system does not support CPUfreq configuration and you can skip this step.

>   ```
>   # cpupower frequency-info --governors
>   analyzing CPU 0:
>     available cpufreq governors: Not Available
>   ```

### Check the current governor mode

You can run the `cpupower frequency-info --policy` command to check the current CPUfreq governor mode:

```
# cpupower frequency-info --policy
analyzing CPU 0:
  current policy: frequency should be within 1.20 GHz and 3.20 GHz.
                  The governor "powersave" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
```

As the above code shows, the current mode is `powersave` in this example. 

### Change the governor mode

- You can run the following command to change the current mode to `performance`:

    ```
    # cpupower frequency-set --governor performance
    ```

- You can also run the following command to set the mode on the target machine in batches:

    ```
    $ ansible -i hosts.ini all -m shell -a "cpupower frequency-set --governor performance" -u tidb -b
    ```

## Step 8: Mount the data disk ext4 filesystem with options on the target machines

Log in to the Control Machine using the `root` user account.

Format your data disks to the ext4 filesystem and mount the filesystem with the `nodelalloc` and `noatime` options. It is required to mount the `nodelalloc` option, or else the Ansible deployment cannot pass the test. The `noatime` option is optional.

> **Note:** If your data disks have been formatted to ext4 and have mounted the options, you can uninstall it by running the `# umount /dev/nvme0n1` command, follow the steps starting from editing the `/etc/fstab` file, and remount the filesystem with options.

Take the `/dev/nvme0n1` data disk as an example:

1. View the data disk.

    ```
    # fdisk -l
    Disk /dev/nvme0n1: 1000 GB
    ```

2. Create the partition table.

    ```
    # parted -s -a optimal /dev/nvme0n1 mklabel gpt -- mkpart primary ext4 1 -1
    ```

3. Format the data disk to the ext4 filesystem.

    ```
    # mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme0n1
    ```

4. View the partition UUID of the data disk.

    In this example, the UUID of `nvme0n1` is `c51eb23b-195c-4061-92a9-3fad812cc12f`.

    ```
    # lsblk -f
    NAME    FSTYPE LABEL UUID                                 MOUNTPOINT
    sda
    ├─sda1  ext4         237b634b-a565-477b-8371-6dff0c41f5ab /boot
    ├─sda2  swap         f414c5c0-f823-4bb1-8fdf-e531173a72ed
    └─sda3  ext4         547909c1-398d-4696-94c6-03e43e317b60 /
    sr0
    nvme0n1 ext4         c51eb23b-195c-4061-92a9-3fad812cc12f
    ```

5. Edit the `/etc/fstab` file and add the mount options.

    ```
    # vi /etc/fstab
    UUID=c51eb23b-195c-4061-92a9-3fad812cc12f /data1 ext4 defaults,nodelalloc,noatime 0 2
    ```

6. Mount the data disk.

    ```
    # mkdir /data1
    # mount -a
    ```

7. Check using the following command.

    ```
    # mount -t ext4
    /dev/nvme0n1 on /data1 type ext4 (rw,noatime,nodelalloc,data=ordered)
    ```

    If the filesystem is ext4 and `nodelalloc` is included in the mount options, you have successfully mount the data disk ext4 filesystem with options on the target machines.

## Step 9: Edit the `inventory.ini` file to orchestrate the TiDB cluster

Log in to the Control Machine using the `tidb` user account, and edit the `tidb-ansible/inventory.ini` file to orchestrate the TiDB cluster. The standard TiDB cluster contains 6 machines: 2 TiDB nodes, 3 PD nodes and 3 TiKV nodes.

- Deploy at least 3 instances for TiKV.
- Do not deploy TiKV together with TiDB or PD on the same machine.
- Use the first TiDB machine as the monitoring machine.

> **Note:** It is required to use the internal IP address to deploy. If the SSH port of the target machines is not the default 22 port, you need to add the `ansible_port` variable. For example, `TiDB1 ansible_host=172.16.10.1 ansible_port=5555`.

You can choose one of the following two types of cluster topology according to your scenario:

- [The cluster topology of a single TiKV instance on each TiKV node](#option-1-use-the-cluster-topology-of-a-single-tikv-instance-on-each-tikv-node)

    In most cases, it is recommended to deploy one TiKV instance on each TiKV node for better performance. However, if the CPU and memory of your TiKV machines are much better than the required in [Hardware and Software Requirements](../op-guide/recommendation.md), and you have more than two disks in one node or the capacity of one SSD is larger than 2 TB, you can deploy no more than 2 TiKV instances on a single TiKV node.

- [The cluster topology of multiple TiKV instances on each TiKV node](#option-2-use-the-cluster-topology-of-multiple-tikv-instances-on-each-tikv-node)

### Option 1: Use the cluster topology of a single TiKV instance on each TiKV node

| Name  | Host IP     | Services   |
|:------|:------------|:-----------|
| node1 | 172.16.10.1 | PD1, TiDB1 |
| node2 | 172.16.10.2 | PD2, TiDB2 |
| node3 | 172.16.10.3 | PD3        |
| node4 | 172.16.10.4 | TiKV1      |
| node5 | 172.16.10.5 | TiKV2      |
| node6 | 172.16.10.6 | TiKV3      |

```ini
[tidb_servers]

172.16.10.2
172.16.10.3

[tikv_servers]
172.16.10.4
172.16.10.5
172.16.10.6

[monitoring_servers]
172.16.10.1

[grafana_servers]
172.16.10.1

[monitored_servers]

172.16.10.3
172.16.10.4
172.16.10.5
172.16.10.6
```

### Option 2: Use the cluster topology of multiple TiKV instances on each TiKV node

Take two TiKV instances on each TiKV node as an example:

| Name  | Host IP     | Services   |
|:------|:------------|:-----------|
| node1 | 172.16.10.1 | PD1, TiDB1 |
| node2 | 172.16.10.2 | PD2, TiDB2  |
| node3 | 172.16.10.3 | PD3         |
| node4 | 172.16.10.4 | TiKV1-1, TiKV1-2 |
| node5 | 172.16.10.5 | TiKV2-1, TiKV2-2 |
| node6 | 172.16.10.6 | TiKV3-1, TiKV3-2 |

```ini
[tidb_servers]
172.16.10.1
172.16.10.2

[pd_servers]
172.16.10.1
172.16.10.2
172.16.10.3

[tikv_servers]
TiKV1-1 ansible_host=172.16.10.4 deploy_dir=/data1/deploy tikv_port=20171 labels="host=tikv1"
TiKV1-2 ansible_host=172.16.10.4 deploy_dir=/data2/deploy tikv_port=20172 labels="host=tikv1"

TiKV3-1 ansible_host=172.16.10.6 deploy_dir=/data1/deploy tikv_port=20171 labels="host=tikv3"
TiKV3-2 ansible_host=172.16.10.6 deploy_dir=/data2/deploy tikv_port=20172 labels="host=tikv3"

[monitoring_servers]
172.16.10.1

[grafana_servers]
172.16.10.1

[monitored_servers]
172.16.10.1
172.16.10.2
172.16.10.3
172.16.10.4
172.16.10.5
172.16.10.6

......

[pd_servers:vars]
location_labels = ["host"]
```

**Edit the parameters in the service configuration file:**

1. For the cluster topology of multiple TiKV instances on each TiKV node, you need to edit the `block-cache-size` parameter in `tidb-ansible/conf/tikv.yml`:

    - `rocksdb defaultcf block-cache-size(GB)`: MEM * 80% / TiKV instance number * 30%
    - `rocksdb writecf block-cache-size(GB)`: MEM * 80% / TiKV instance number * 45%
    - `rocksdb lockcf block-cache-size(GB)`: MEM * 80% / TiKV instance number * 2.5% (128 MB at a minimum)
    - `raftdb defaultcf block-cache-size(GB)`: MEM * 80% / TiKV instance number * 2.5% (128 MB at a minimum)

2. For the cluster topology of multiple TiKV instances on each TiKV node, you need to edit the `high-concurrency`, `normal-concurrency` and `low-concurrency` parameters in the `tidb-ansible/conf/tikv.yml` file:

    ```
    readpool:
    coprocessor:
        # Notice: if CPU_NUM > 8, default thread pool size for coprocessors
        # will be set to CPU_NUM * 0.8.
        # high-concurrency: 8
        # normal-concurrency: 8
        # low-concurrency: 8
    ```

    Recommended configuration: `number of instances * parameter value = CPU_Vcores * 0.8`.

3. If multiple TiKV instances are deployed on a same physical disk, edit the `capacity` parameter in `conf/tikv.yml`:

    - `capacity`: total disk capacity / number of TiKV instances (the unit is GB)

## Step 10: Edit variables in the `inventory.ini` file

This step describes how to edit the variable of deployment directory and other variables in the `inventory.ini` file.

### Configure the deployment directory

Edit the `deploy_dir` variable to configure the deployment directory.

The global variable is set to `/home/tidb/deploy` by default, and it applies to all services. If the data disk is mounted on the `/data1` directory, you can set it to `/data1/deploy`. For example:

```bash
## Global variables
[all:vars]
deploy_dir = /data1/deploy
```

**Note:** To separately set the deployment directory for a service, you can configure the host variable while configuring the service host list in the `inventory.ini` file. It is required to add the first column alias, to avoid confusion in scenarios of mixed services deployment.

```bash
TiKV1-1 ansible_host=172.16.10.4 deploy_dir=/data1/deploy
```

### Edit other variables (Optional)

To enable the following control variables, use the capitalized `True`. To disable the following control variables, use the capitalized `False`.

| Variable Name | Description |
| ---- | ------- |
| cluster_name | the name of a cluster, adjustable |
| tidb_version | the version of TiDB, configured by default in TiDB-Ansible branches |
| process_supervision | the supervision way of processes, systemd by default, supervise optional |
| timezone | the timezone of the managed node, adjustable, `Asia/Shanghai` by default, used together with the `set_timezone` variable |
| set_timezone | to edit the timezone of the managed node, True by default; False means closing |
| enable_firewalld | to enable the firewall, closed by default; to enable it, add the ports in [network requirements](recommendation.md#network-requirements) to the white list |
| enable_ntpd | to monitor the NTP service of the managed node, True by default; do not close it |
| set_hostname | to edit the hostname of the mananged node based on the IP, False by default |
| dev_mode | CPU, memory and disk performance will not be checked when dev_mode = True, False by default |
| enable_binlog | whether to deploy Pump and enable the binlog, False by default, dependent on the Kafka cluster; see the `zookeeper_addrs` variable |
| zookeeper_addrs | the zookeeper address of the binlog Kafka cluster |
| enable_slow_query_log | to record the slow query log of TiDB into a single file: ({{ deploy_dir }}/log/tidb_slow_query.log). False by default, to record it into the TiDB log |
| deploy_without_tidb | the Key-Value mode, deploy only PD, TiKV and the monitoring service, not TiDB; set the IP of the tidb_servers host group to null in the `inventory.ini` file |
| alertmanager_target | optional: If you have deployed `alertmanager` separately, you can configure this variable using the `alertmanager_host:alertmanager_port` format |
| grafana_admin_user | the username of Grafana administrator; default `admin` |
| grafana_admin_password | the password of Grafana administrator account; default `admin`; used to import Dashboard and create the API key using Ansible; update this variable if you have modified it through Grafana web |
| collect_log_recent_hours | to collect the log of recent hours; default the recent 2 hours |
| enable_bandwidth_limit | to set a bandwidth limit when pulling the diagnostic data from the target machines to the Control Machine; used together with the `collect_bandwidth_limit` variable |
| collect_bandwidth_limit | the limited bandwidth when pulling the diagnostic data from the target machines to the Control Machine; unit: Kbit/s; default 10000, indicating 10Mb/s; for the cluster topology of multiple TiKV instances on each TiKV node, you need to divide the number of the TiKV instances on each TiKV node |

## Step 11: Deploy the TiDB cluster

When `ansible-playbook` runs Playbook, the default concurrent number is 5. If many deployment target machines are deployed, you can add the `-f` parameter to specify the concurrency, such as `ansible-playbook deploy.yml -f 10`.

The following example uses `tidb` as the user who runs the service.

1. Edit the `tidb-ansible/inventory.ini` file to make sure `ansible_user = tidb`.

    ```
    ## Connection
    # ssh via normal user
    ansible_user = tidb
    ```

    > **Note:** Do not configure `ansible_user` to `root`, because `tidb-ansible` limits the user that runs the service to the normal user.

    Run the following command and if all servers return `tidb`, then the SSH mutual trust is successfully configured:

    ```
    ansible -i inventory.ini all -m shell -a 'whoami'
    ```

    Run the following command and if all servers return `root`, then sudo without password of the `tidb` user is successfully configured:

    ```
    ansible -i inventory.ini all -m shell -a 'whoami' -b
    ```

2. Run the `local_prepare.yml` playbook and download TiDB binary to the Control Machine.

    ```
    ansible-playbook local_prepare.yml
    ```

3. Initialize the system environment and modify the kernel parameters.

    ```
    ansible-playbook bootstrap.yml
    ```

4. Deploy the TiDB cluster software.

    ```
    ansible-playbook deploy.yml
    ```

    > **Note:** You can use the `Report` button on the Grafana Dashboard to generate the PDF file. This function depends on the `fontconfig` package and English fonts. To use this function, log in to the `grafana_servers` machine and install it using the following command:
    >
    > ```
    > $ sudo yum install fontconfig open-sans-fonts
    > ```

5. Start the TiDB cluster.

    ```
    ansible-playbook start.yml
    ```

> **Note:** If you want to deploy TiDB using the root user account, see [Ansible Deployment Using the Root User Account](root-ansible-deployment.md).

## Test the TiDB cluster

Because TiDB is compatible with MySQL, you must use the MySQL client to connect to TiDB directly. It is recommended to configure load balancing to provide uniform SQL interface.

1. Connect to the TiDB cluster using the MySQL client.

    ```sql
    mysql -u root -h 172.16.10.1 -P 4000
    ```

    > **Note**: The default port of TiDB service is 4000.

2. Access the monitoring platform using a web browser.

    ```
    http://172.16.10.1:3000
    ```

    > **Note**: The default account and password: `admin`/`admin`.

### How to check whether the NTP service is normal?

1. Run the following command. If it returns `running`, then the NTP service is running:

    ```
    $ sudo systemctl status ntpd.service
    ntpd.service - Network Time Service
    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/ntpd.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
    Active: active (running) since 一 2017-12-18 13:13:19 CST; 3s ago
    ```

2. Run the ntpstat command. If it returns `synchronised to NTP server` (synchronizing with the NTP server), then the synchronization process is normal.

    ```
    $ ntpstat
    synchronised to NTP server (85.199.214.101) at stratum 2
    time correct to within 91 ms
    polling server every 1024 s
    ```

> **Note:** For the Ubuntu system, you need to install the `ntpstat` package.

- The following condition indicates the NTP service is not synchronizing normally:

    ```
    $ ntpstat
    unsynchronised
    ```

- The following condition indicates the NTP service is not running normally:

    ```
    $ ntpstat
    Unable to talk to NTP daemon. Is it running?
    ```

- To make the NTP service start synchronizing as soon as possible, run the following command. You can replace `pool.ntp.org` with other NTP servers.

    ```
    $ sudo systemctl stop ntpd.service
    $ sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org
    $ sudo systemctl start ntpd.service
    ```

- To install the NTP service manually on the CentOS 7 system, run the following command:

    ```
    $ sudo yum install ntp ntpdate
    $ sudo systemctl start ntpd.service
    $ sudo systemctl enable ntpd.service
    ```

### How to modify the supervision method of a process from `supervise` to `systemd`?

Run the following command:

```
# process supervision, [systemd, supervise]
process_supervision = systemd
```

For versions earlier than TiDB 1.0.4, the TiDB-Ansible supervision method of a process is `supervise` by default. The previously installed cluster can remain the same. If you need to change the supervision method to `systemd`, stop the cluster and run the following command:

```
ansible-playbook stop.yml
ansible-playbook deploy.yml -D
ansible-playbook start.yml
```

### How to manually configure the SSH mutual trust and sudo without password?

Log in to the deployment target machine using the `root` user account, create the `tidb` user and set the login password.

```
# useradd tidb
# passwd tidb
```

To configure sudo without password, run the following command, and add `tidb ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` to the end of the file:

```
# visudo
tidb ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

Use the `tidb` user to log in to the Control Machine, and run the following command. Replace `172.16.10.61` with the IP of your deployment target machine, and enter the `tidb` user password of the deployment target machine as prompted. Successful execution indicates that SSH mutual trust is already created. This applies to other machines as well.

```
[tidb@172.16.10.49 ~]$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 172.16.10.61
```

Log in to the Control Machine using the `tidb` user account, and log in to the IP of the target machine using SSH. If you do not need to enter the password and can successfully log in, then the SSH mutual trust is successfully configured.

```
[tidb@172.16.10.49 ~]$ ssh 172.16.10.61
[tidb@172.16.10.61 ~]$
```

After you login to the deployment target machine using the `tidb` user, run the following command. If you do not need to enter the password and can switch to the `root` user, then sudo without password of the `tidb` user is successfully configured.

```
[tidb@172.16.10.61 ~]$ sudo -su root
[root@172.16.10.61 tidb]#
```

### Error: You need to install jmespath prior to running json_query filter

See [Install Ansible and its dependencies on the Control Machine](#step-4-install-ansible-and-its-dependencies-on-the-control-machine) and use `pip` to install Ansible and the related specific dependencies in the Control Machine. The `jmespath` dependent package is installed by default.

Enter `import jmespath` in the Python interactive window of the Control Machine.

- If no error displays, the dependency is successfully installed.
- If the `ImportError: No module named jmespath` error displays, the Python `jmespath` module is not successfully installed.

```
$ python
Python 2.7.5 (default, Nov  6 2016, 00:28:07)

### The `zk: node does not exist` error when starting Pump/Drainer

Check whether the `zookeeper_addrs` configuration in `inventory.ini` is the same with the configuration in the Kafka cluster, and whether the namespace is filled in. The description about namespace configuration is as follows:

```
# ZooKeeper connection string (see ZooKeeper docs for details).
# ZooKeeper address of the Kafka cluster. Example:
# zookeeper_addrs = "192.168.0.11:2181,192.168.0.12:2181,192.168.0.13:2181"
# You can also append an optional chroot string to the URLs to specify the root directory for all Kafka znodes. Example:
# zookeeper_addrs = "192.168.0.11:2181,192.168.0.12:2181,192.168.0.13:2181/kafka/123"
```
