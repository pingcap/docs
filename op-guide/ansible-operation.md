# TiDB-Ansible Common Operations

This guide describes the common operations when you administer a TiDB cluster using TiDB-Ansible.

## Start a cluster

```bash
$ ansible-playbook start.yml
```

This operation starts all the components in the entire TiDB cluster in order, which include PD, TiDB, TiKV, and the monitoring components.

## Stop a cluster

```bash
$ ansible-playbook stop.yml
```

This operation stops all the components in the entire TiDB cluster in order, which include PD, TiDB, TiKV, and the monitoring components.

## Clean up cluster data

```
$ ansible-playbook unsafe_cleanup_data.yml
```

This operation stops the TiDB, Pump, TiKV and PD services, and cleans up the data directory of Pump, TiKV and PD.

## Destroy a cluster

```
$ ansible-playbook unsafe_cleanup.yml
```

This operation stops the cluster and cleans up the data directory.

> **Note:** If the deployment directory is a mount point, an error will be reported, but implementation results remain unaffected, so you can ignore it.
