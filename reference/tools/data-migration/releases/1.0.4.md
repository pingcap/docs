# DM 1.0.4 Release Notes

Release date: March 13, 2020

DM version: 1.0.4

DM-Ansible version: 1.0.4

## Improvements

- Add English UI for DM-portal
- Add the `--more` parameter in the `query-status` command to show complete replication status information

## Bug fixes

- Fix the issue that `resume-task` might fail to resume the replication task which is interrupted by the abnormal connection to the downstream TiDB server
- Fix the issue that the online DDL operation cannot be properly replicated after a failed replication task is restarted because the online DDL meta information has been cleared after the DDL operation failure
- Fix the issue that `query-error` might cause the DM-worker to panic after `start-task` goes into error
- Fix the issue that the relay log file and `relay.meta` cannot be correctly recovered when restarting an abnormally stopped DM-worker process before `relay.meta` is successfully written
