# Error Codes and Troubleshooting

This document describes the problems encountered during the use of TiDB and provides the solutions.

## Error codes

TiDB is compatible with the error codes in MySQL, and in most cases returns the same error code as MySQL. For a list of error codes for MySQL, see [Server Error Message Reference](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-error-reference.html).
In addition, TiDB has the following unique error codes:

* Error Number: 8001

    The memory used by the request exceeds the threshold limit for the TiDB memory usage.

    Increase the value of the system variable with the `tidb_mem_quota` prefix.

* Error Number: 8002

    To guarantee consistency, a transaction with the `SELECT FOR UPDATE` statement cannot be retried when it encounters a commit conflict. TiDB rolls back the transaction and returns this error.

    Retry the failed transaction.

* Error Number: 8003

    If the data in a row is not consistent with the index when executing the `ADMIN CHECK TABLE` command, TiDB returns this error.

* Error Number: 8004

    A single transaction is too large.

    See [the error message `transaction too large`](/faq/tidb.md#the-error-message-transaction-too-large-is-displayed) for the cause and solution.

* Error Number: 8005

    Transactions in TiDB encounter write conflicts.

    See [the Troubleshoot section](/faq/tidb.md#troubleshoot) for the cause and solution.
