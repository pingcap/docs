# Partitioning

This document introduces TiDB's implementation of partitioning.

## Partitioning types

This section introduces the types of partitioning which are available in TiDB. Currently, TiDB supports range partitioning and hash partitioning.

Range partitioning is used to resolve the performance issues caused by a large amount of deletions in the application, and it supports fast drop partition operations. Hash partitioning is used to scatter the data when there are a large amount of writes.

### Range partitioning

When a table is partitioned by range, each partition contains rows for which the partitioning expression value lies within a given range. Ranges have to be contiguous but not overlapping. You can define it by using the `VALUES LESS THAN` operation.

Assume you need to create a table that contains personnel records as follows:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    fname VARCHAR(30),
    lname VARCHAR(30),
    hired DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '1970-01-01',
    separated DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '9999-12-31',
    job_code INT NOT NULL,
    store_id INT NOT NULL
);
```

You can partition a table by range in various ways as needed. For example, you can partition it by using the `store_id` column:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    fname VARCHAR(30),
    lname VARCHAR(30),
    hired DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '1970-01-01',
    separated DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '9999-12-31',
    job_code INT NOT NULL,
    store_id INT NOT NULL
)

PARTITION BY RANGE (store_id) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (6),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (11),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (16),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (21)
);
```

In this partition scheme, all rows corresponding to employees whose `store_id` is 1 through 5 are stored in the `p0` partition while all employees whose `store_id` is 6 through 10 are stored in `p1`. Range partitioning requires the partitions to be ordered, from lowest to highest.

If you insert a row of data `(72, 'Mitchell', 'Wilson', '1998-06-25', NULL, 13)`, it falls in the `p2` partition. But if you insert a record whose `store_id` is larger than 20, an error is reported because TiDB can not know which partition this record should be inserted into. In this case, you can use `MAXVALUE` when creating a table:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    fname VARCHAR(30),
    lname VARCHAR(30),
    hired DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '1970-01-01',
    separated DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '9999-12-31',
    job_code INT NOT NULL,
    store_id INT NOT NULL
)

PARTITION BY RANGE (store_id) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (6),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (11),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (16),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
);
```

`MAXVALUE` represents an integer value that is larger than all other integer values. Now, all records whose `store_id` is equal to or larger than 16 (the highest value defined) are stored in the `p3` partition.

You can also partition a table by employees' job codes, which are the values of the `job_code` column. Assume that two-digit job codes stand for regular employees, three-digit codes stand for office and customer support personnel, and four-digit codes stand for managerial personnel. Then you can create a partitioned table like this:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    fname VARCHAR(30),
    lname VARCHAR(30),
    hired DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '1970-01-01',
    separated DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '9999-12-31',
    job_code INT NOT NULL,
    store_id INT NOT NULL
)

PARTITION BY RANGE (job_code) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (100),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (1000),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (10000)
);
```

In this example, all rows relating to regular employees are stored in the `p0` partition, all office and customer support personnel in the `p1` partition, and all managerial personnel in the `p2` partition.

Besides splitting up the table by `store_id`, you can also partition a table by dates. For example, you can partition by employees' separation year:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    fname VARCHAR(30),
    lname VARCHAR(30),
    hired DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '1970-01-01',
    separated DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '9999-12-31',
    job_code INT,
    store_id INT
)

PARTITION BY RANGE ( YEAR(separated) ) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (1991),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (1996),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (2001),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
);
```

In range partitioning, you can partition based on the values of the `timestamp` column and use the `unix_timestamp()` function, for example:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE TABLE quarterly_report_status (
    report_id INT NOT NULL,
    report_status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    report_updated TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)

PARTITION BY RANGE ( UNIX_TIMESTAMP(report_updated) ) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN ( UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2008-01-01 00:00:00') ),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN ( UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2008-04-01 00:00:00') ),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN ( UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2008-07-01 00:00:00') ),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN ( UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2008-10-01 00:00:00') ),
    PARTITION p4 VALUES LESS THAN ( UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2009-01-01 00:00:00') ),
    PARTITION p5 VALUES LESS THAN ( UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2009-04-01 00:00:00') ),
    PARTITION p6 VALUES LESS THAN ( UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2009-07-01 00:00:00') ),
    PARTITION p7 VALUES LESS THAN ( UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2009-10-01 00:00:00') ),
    PARTITION p8 VALUES LESS THAN ( UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2010-01-01 00:00:00') ),
    PARTITION p9 VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
);
```

It is not allowed to use any other partitioning expression that contains the timestamp values.

Range partitioning is particularly useful when one or more of the following conditions are satisfied:

* You want to delete the old data. If you use the `employees` table in the previous example, you can delete all records of employees who left this company before the year 1991 by simply using `ALTER TABLE employees DROP PARTITION p0;`. It is faster than executing the `DELETE FROM employees WHERE YEAR(separated) <= 1990;` operation.
* You want to use a column that contains time or date values, or containing values arising from some other series.
* You need to frequently run queries on the columns used for partitioning. For example, when executing a query like `EXPLAIN SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE separated BETWEEN '2000-01-01' AND '2000-12-31' GROUP BY store_id;`, TiDB can quickly know that only the data in the `p2` partition needs to be scanned, because the other partitions do not match the `WHERE` condition.

### Hash partitioning

Hash partitioning is used to make sure that data is evenly scattered into a certain number of partitions. With range partitioning, you must specify the range of the column values for each partition when you use range partitioning, while you just need to specify the number of partitions when you use hash partitioning.

Partitioning by hash requires you to append a `PARTITION BY HASH (expr)` clause to the `CREATE TABLE` statement. `expr` is an expression that returns an integer. It can be a column name if the type of this column is integer. In addition, you might also need to append `PARTITIONS num`, where `num` is a positive integer indicating how many partitions a table is divided into.

The following operation creates a hash partitioned table, which is divided into 4 partitions by `store_id`:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    fname VARCHAR(30),
    lname VARCHAR(30),
    hired DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '1970-01-01',
    separated DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '9999-12-31',
    job_code INT,
    store_id INT
)

PARTITION BY HASH(store_id)
PARTITIONS 4;
```

If `PARTITIONS num` is not specified, the default number of partitions is 1.

You can also use an SQL expression that returns an integer for `expr`. For example, you can partition a table by the hire year:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    fname VARCHAR(30),
    lname VARCHAR(30),
    hired DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '1970-01-01',
    separated DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT '9999-12-31',
    job_code INT,
    store_id INT
)

PARTITION BY HASH( YEAR(hired) )
PARTITIONS 4;
```

The most efficient hash function is one which operates upon a single table column, and whose value increases or decreases consistently with the column value, as this allows for “pruning” on ranges of partitions.

For example, `date_col` is a column whose type is `DATE`, and the value of the `TO_DAYS(date_col)` expression varies with the value of `date_col`. `YEAR(date_col)` is different from `TO_DAYS(date_col)`, because not every possible change in `date_col` produces an equivalent change in `YEAR(date_col)`. Even so, `YEAR(date_col)` is still a good hash function, because its value varies in proportion to the value of `date_col`.

In contrast, assume that you have an `int_col` column whose type is `INT`. Now consider about the expression `POW(5-int_col,3) + 6`. It is not a good hash function though, because as the value of `int_col` changes, the result of the expression does not change proportionally. A value change in `int_col` might result in a huge change in the expression result. For example, when `int_col` changes from 5 to 6, the change of the expression result is -1. But the result change might be -7 when `int_col` changes from 6 to 7.

In conclusion, when the expression has a form that is closer to `y = cx`, it is more suitable to be a hash function. Because the more non-linear an expression is, the more unevenly scattered the data among the partitions tends to be.

In theory, pruning is also possible for expressions involving more than one column value, but determining which of such expressions are suitable can be quite difficult and time-consuming. For this reason, the use of hashing expressions involving multiple columns is not particularly recommended.

When using `PARTITIION BY HASH`, TiDB decides which partition the data should fall into based on the modulus of the result of the expression. In other words, if a partitioning expression is `expr` and the number of partitions is `num`, `MOD(expr, num)` decides the partition in which the data is stored. Assume that `t1` is defined as follows:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (col1 INT, col2 CHAR(5), col3 DATE)
    PARTITION BY HASH( YEAR(col3) )
    PARTITIONS 4;
```

When you insert a row of data into `t1` and the value of `col3` is '2005-09-15', then this row is inserted into partition 1:

```
MOD(YEAR('2005-09-01'),4)
=  MOD(2005,4)
=  1
```

### How TiDB partitioning handles NULL

It is allowed in TiDB to use `NULL` as the calculation result of a partitioning expression.

> **Note:**
>
> `NULL` is not an integer. TiDB's partitioning implementation treats `NULL` as being less than any other integer values, just as `ORDER BY` does.

#### Handling of NULL with range partitioning

When you insert a row into a table partitioned by range, and the column value used to determine the partition is `NULL`, then this row is inserted into the lowest partition.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (
    c1 INT,
    c2 VARCHAR(20)
)

PARTITION BY RANGE(c1) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (0),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (10),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
);
```

```
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.09 sec)
```

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
select * from t1 partition(p0);
```

```
+------|--------+
| c1   | c2     |
+------|--------+
| NULL | mothra |
+------|--------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
select * from t1 partition(p1);
```

```
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
select * from t1 partition(p2);
```

```
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

Drop the `p0` partition and verify the result:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
alter table t1 drop partition p0;
```

```
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.08 sec)
```

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
select * from t1;
```

```
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

#### Handling of NULL with hash partitioning

When partitioning tables by hash, there is a different way of handling `NULL` value - if the calculation result of the partitioning expression is `NULL`, it is considered as `0`.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE TABLE th (
    c1 INT,
    c2 VARCHAR(20)
)

PARTITION BY HASH(c1)
PARTITIONS 2;
```

```
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
INSERT INTO th VALUES (NULL, 'mothra'), (0, 'gigan');
```

```
Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.04 sec)
```

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
select * from th partition (p0);
```

```
+------|--------+
| c1   | c2     |
+------|--------+
| NULL | mothra |
|    0 | gigan  |
+------|--------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
select * from th partition (p1);
```

```
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

You can see that the inserted record `(NULL, 'mothra')` falls into the same partition as `(0, 'gigan')`.

## Partition management

You can add, drop, merge, split, redefine partitions by using `ALTER TABLE` statements.

### Range partition management

Create a partitioned table:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE TABLE members (
    id INT,
    fname VARCHAR(25),
    lname VARCHAR(25),
    dob DATE
)

PARTITION BY RANGE( YEAR(dob) ) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (1980),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (1990),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (2000)
);
```

Drop a partition:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
ALTER TABLE members DROP PARTITION p2;
```

```
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)
```

Empty a partition:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
ALTER TABLE members TRUNCATE PARTITION p1;
```

```
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)
```

> **Note:**
>
> `ALTER TABLE ... REORGANIZE PARTITION` is currently unsupported in TiDB.

Add a partition:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
ALTER TABLE members ADD PARTITION (PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (2010));
```

When partitioning tables by range, `ADD PARTITION` can be only appended to the very end of a partition list. If it is appended to an existing partition range, an error is reported:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
ALTER TABLE members
    ADD PARTITION (
    PARTITION n VALUES LESS THAN (1970));
```

```
ERROR 1463 (HY000): VALUES LESS THAN value must be strictly »
   increasing for each partition
```

### Hash partition management

Unlike range partitioning, `DROP PARTITION` is not supported in hash partitioning.

Currently, `ALTER TABLE ... COALESCE PARTITION` is not supported in TiDB as well.

## Partition pruning

Partition pruning is an optimization which is based on a very simple idea - do not scan the partitions that do not match.

Assume that you create a partitioned table `t1`:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (
    fname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    lname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    region_code TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    dob DATE NOT NULL
)

PARTITION BY RANGE( region_code ) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (64),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (128),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (192),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
);
```

If you want to get the result of this `SELECT` statement:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SELECT fname, lname, region_code, dob
    FROM t1
    WHERE region_code > 125 AND region_code < 130;
```

It is evident that the result falls in either the `p1` or the `p2` partition, that is, you just need to search for the matching rows in `p1` and `p2`. Excluding the unneeded partitions is so-called "pruning". If the optimizer is able to prune a part of partitions, the execution of the query in the partitioned table will be much faster than that in a non-partitioned table.

The optimizer can prune partitions through `WHERE` conditions in the following two scenarios:

* partition_column = constant
* partition_column IN (constant1, constant2, ..., constantN)

## Partition selection

`SELECT` statements support partition selection, which is implemented by using a `PARTITION` option.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees  (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    fname VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
    lname VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
    store_id INT NOT NULL,
    department_id INT NOT NULL
)

PARTITION BY RANGE(id)  (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (5),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (10),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (15),
    PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE
);

INSERT INTO employees VALUES
    ('', 'Bob', 'Taylor', 3, 2), ('', 'Frank', 'Williams', 1, 2),
    ('', 'Ellen', 'Johnson', 3, 4), ('', 'Jim', 'Smith', 2, 4),
    ('', 'Mary', 'Jones', 1, 1), ('', 'Linda', 'Black', 2, 3),
    ('', 'Ed', 'Jones', 2, 1), ('', 'June', 'Wilson', 3, 1),
    ('', 'Andy', 'Smith', 1, 3), ('', 'Lou', 'Waters', 2, 4),
    ('', 'Jill', 'Stone', 1, 4), ('', 'Roger', 'White', 3, 2),
    ('', 'Howard', 'Andrews', 1, 2), ('', 'Fred', 'Goldberg', 3, 3),
    ('', 'Barbara', 'Brown', 2, 3), ('', 'Alice', 'Rogers', 2, 2),
    ('', 'Mark', 'Morgan', 3, 3), ('', 'Karen', 'Cole', 3, 2);
```

You can view the rows stored in the `p1` partition:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees PARTITION (p1);
```

```
+----|-------|--------|----------|---------------+
| id | fname | lname  | store_id | department_id |
+----|-------|--------|----------|---------------+
|  5 | Mary  | Jones  |        1 |             1 |
|  6 | Linda | Black  |        2 |             3 |
|  7 | Ed    | Jones  |        2 |             1 |
|  8 | June  | Wilson |        3 |             1 |
|  9 | Andy  | Smith  |        1 |             3 |
+----|-------|--------|----------|---------------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

If you want to get the rows in multiple partitions, you can use a list of partition names which are separated by commas. For example, `SELECT * FROM employees PARTITION (p1, p2)` returns all rows in the `p1` and `p2` partitions.

When you use partition selection, you can still use `WHERE` conditions and options such as `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`. It is also supported to use aggregation options such as `HAVING` and `GROUP BY`.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees PARTITION (p0, p2)
    WHERE lname LIKE 'S%';
```

```
+----|-------|-------|----------|---------------+
| id | fname | lname | store_id | department_id |
+----|-------|-------|----------|---------------+
|  4 | Jim   | Smith |        2 |             4 |
| 11 | Jill  | Stone |        1 |             4 |
+----|-------|-------|----------|---------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SELECT id, CONCAT(fname, ' ', lname) AS name
    FROM employees PARTITION (p0) ORDER BY lname;
```

```
+----|----------------+
| id | name           |
+----|----------------+
|  3 | Ellen Johnson  |
|  4 | Jim Smith      |
|  1 | Bob Taylor     |
|  2 | Frank Williams |
+----|----------------+
4 rows in set (0.06 sec)
```

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SELECT store_id, COUNT(department_id) AS c
    FROM employees PARTITION (p1,p2,p3)
    GROUP BY store_id HAVING c > 4;
```

```
+---|----------+
| c | store_id |
+---|----------+
| 5 |        2 |
| 5 |        3 |
+---|----------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Partition selection is supported for all types of table partitioning, including range partitioning and hash partitioning. For hash partitions, if partition names are not specified, `p0`, `p1`, `p2`,..., or `pN-1` is automatically used as the partition name.

`SELECT` in `INSERT ... SELECT` can also use partition selection.

## Restrictions and limitations on partitions

This section introduces some restrictions and limitations on partitioned tables in TiDB.

### Partitioning keys, primary keys and unique keys

This section discusses the relationship of partitioning keys with primary keys and unique keys. The rule governing this relationship can be expressed as follows: **Every unique key on the table must use every column in the table's partitioning expression**. This also includes the table's primary key, because it is by definition a unique key.

For example, the following table creation statements are invalid:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (
    col1 INT NOT NULL,
    col2 DATE NOT NULL,
    col3 INT NOT NULL,
    col4 INT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE KEY (col1, col2)
)

PARTITION BY HASH(col3)
PARTITIONS 4;

CREATE TABLE t2 (
    col1 INT NOT NULL,
    col2 DATE NOT NULL,
    col3 INT NOT NULL,
    col4 INT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE KEY (col1),
    UNIQUE KEY (col3)
)

PARTITION BY HASH(col1 + col3)
PARTITIONS 4;
```

In each case, the proposed table has at least one unique key that does not include all columns used in the partitioning expression.

The valid statements are as follows:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (
    col1 INT NOT NULL,
    col2 DATE NOT NULL,
    col3 INT NOT NULL,
    col4 INT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE KEY (col1, col2, col3)
)

PARTITION BY HASH(col3)
PARTITIONS 4;

CREATE TABLE t2 (
    col1 INT NOT NULL,
    col2 DATE NOT NULL,
    col3 INT NOT NULL,
    col4 INT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE KEY (col1, col3)
)

PARTITION BY HASH(col1 + col3)
PARTITIONS 4;
```

The following example displays an error:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE TABLE t3 (
    col1 INT NOT NULL,
    col2 DATE NOT NULL,
    col3 INT NOT NULL,
    col4 INT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE KEY (col1, col2),
    UNIQUE KEY (col3)
)

PARTITION BY HASH(col1 + col3)
PARTITIONS 4;
```

```
ERROR 1491 (HY000): A PRIMARY KEY must include all columns in the table's partitioning function
```

The `CREATE TABLE` statement fails because both `col1` and `col3` are included in the proposed partitioning key, but neither of these columns is part of both of unique keys on the table.

The following table cannot be partitioned at all, because there is no way to include in a partitioning key any columns that belong to both unique keys:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE TABLE t4 (
    col1 INT NOT NULL,
    col2 INT NOT NULL,
    col3 INT NOT NULL,
    col4 INT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE KEY (col1, col3),
    UNIQUE KEY (col2, col4)
);
```

Because every primary key is by definition a unique key, so the next two statements are invalid:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE TABLE t5 (
    col1 INT NOT NULL,
    col2 DATE NOT NULL,
    col3 INT NOT NULL,
    col4 INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(col1, col2)
)

PARTITION BY HASH(col3)
PARTITIONS 4;

CREATE TABLE t6 (
    col1 INT NOT NULL,
    col2 DATE NOT NULL,
    col3 INT NOT NULL,
    col4 INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(col1, col3),
    UNIQUE KEY(col2)
)

PARTITION BY HASH( YEAR(col2) )
PARTITIONS 4;
```

In both cases, the primary key does not include all columns referenced in the partitioning expression.

If a table has neither unique keys nor primary keys, then this restriction does not apply.

When you change tables using DDL statements, you also need to consider this restriction when adding a unique index. For example, when you create a partitioned table as shown below:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE TABLE t_no_pk (c1 INT, c2 INT)
    PARTITION BY RANGE(c1) (
        PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (10),
        PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (20),
        PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (30),
        PARTITION p3 VALUES LESS THAN (40)
    );
```

```

You can add a non-unique index by using `ALTER TABLE` statements. But if you want to add a unique index, the `c1` column must be included in the unique index.

### Partitioning limitations relating to functions

Only the functions shown in the following list are allowed in partitioning expressions:

```
ABS()
CEILING() (see CEILING() and FLOOR())
DATEDIFF()
DAY()
DAYOFMONTH()
DAYOFWEEK()
DAYOFYEAR()
EXTRACT() (see EXTRACT() function with WEEK specifier)
FLOOR() (see CEILING() and FLOOR())
HOUR()
MICROSECOND()
MINUTE()
MOD()
MONTH()
QUARTER()
SECOND()
TIME_TO_SEC()
TO_DAYS()
TO_SECONDS()
UNIX_TIMESTAMP() (with TIMESTAMP columns)
WEEKDAY()
YEAR()
YEARWEEK()
```

### Compatibility with MySQL

Currently, TiDB only supports range partitioning and hash partitioning. Other partitioning types that are available in MySQL such as list partitioning and key partitioning are not supported yet in TiDB.

For a table partitioned by `RANGE COLUMNS`, currently TiDB only supports using a single partitioning column.

With regard to partition management, any operation that requires moving data in the bottom implementation is not supported currently, including but not limited to: adjust the number of partitions in a hash partitioned table, modify the range of a range partitioned table, merge partitions and exchange partitions.

For the unsupported partitioning types, when you create a table in TiDB, the partitioning information is ignored and the table is created in the regular form with a warning reported. `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITION` tables are not supported currently in TiDB.

The `LOAD DATA` syntax does not support partition selection currently in TiDB.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
create table t (id int, val int) partition by hash(id) partitions 4;
```

The regular `LOAD DATA` operation is supported:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
load local data infile "xxx" into t ...
```

But `Load Data` does not support partition selection:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
load local data infile "xxx" into t partition (p1)...
```

For a partitioned table, the result returned by `select * from t` is unordered between the partitions. This is different from the result in MySQL, which is ordered between the partitions but unordered inside the partitions.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
create table t (id int, val int) partition by range (id) (
    partition p0 values less than (3),
    partition p1 values less than (7),
    partition p2 values less than (11));
```

```
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.10 sec)
```

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
insert into t values (1, 2), (3, 4),(5, 6),(7,8),(9,10);
```

```
Query OK, 5 rows affected (0.01 sec)
Records: 5  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

TiDB returns a different result every time, for example:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
select * from t;
```

```
+------|------+
| id   | val  |
+------|------+
|    7 |    8 |
|    9 |   10 |
|    1 |    2 |
|    3 |    4 |
|    5 |    6 |
+------|------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

The result returned in MySQL:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
select * from t;
```

```
+------|------+
| id   | val  |
+------|------+
|    1 |    2 |
|    3 |    4 |
|    5 |    6 |
|    7 |    8 |
|    9 |   10 |
+------|------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```
