The `DROP SEQUENCE` statement drops the sequence object in TiDB.

## Synopsis

**TableNameList:**

## Examples

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
DROP SEQUENCE seq;
```

```
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.10 sec)
```

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
DROP SEQUENCE seq, seq2;
```

```
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)
```

## MySQL compatibility

Currently, MySQL does not have the sequence option. The TiDB sequence is borrowed from MariaDB. Except for the `SETVAL` function, all other functions have the same progressions with those functions of MariaDB.
