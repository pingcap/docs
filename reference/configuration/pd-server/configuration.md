# PD Configuration Flags

PD is configurable using command-line flags and environment variables.

## `--advertise-client-urls`

- The advertise URL list for client traffic from outside
- Default: ${client-urls}
- If the client cannot connect to PD through the default listening client URLs, you must manually set the advertise client URLs explicitly.
- For example, the internal IP address of Docker is 172.17.0.1, while the IP address of the host is 192.168.100.113 and the port mapping is set to `-p 2379:2379`. In this case, you can set `--advertise-client-urls` to `http://192.168.100.113:2379`. The client can find this service through `http://192.168.100.113:2379`.

## `--advertise-peer-urls`

- The advertise URL list for peer traffic from outside
- Default: ${peer-urls}
- If the peer cannot connect to PD through the default listening peer URLs, you must manually set the advertise peer URLs explicitly.
- For example, the internal IP address of Docker is 172.17.0.1, while the IP address of the host is 192.168.100.113 and the port mapping is set to `-p 2380:2380`. In this case, you can set `--advertise-peer-urls` to `http://192.168.100.113:2380`. The other PD nodes can find this service through `http://192.168.100.113:2380`.

## `--client-urls`

- The listening URL list for client traffic
- Default: `http://127.0.0.1:2379`
- To deploy a cluster, you must use `--client-urls` to specify the IP address of the current host, such as `http://192.168.100.113:2379`. If the cluster runs on Docker, specify the IP address of Docker as `http://0.0.0.0:2379`.

## `--peer-urls`

- The listening URL list for peer traffic
- Default: `http://127.0.0.1:2380`
- To deploy a cluster, you must use `--peer-urls` to specify the IP address of the current host, such as `http://192.168.100.113:2380`. If the cluster runs on Docker, specify the IP address of Docker as `http://0.0.0.0:2380`.

## `--config`

- The configuration file
- Default: ""
- If you set the configuration using the command line, the same setting in the configuration file will be overwritten.

## `--data-dir`

- The path to the data directory
- Default: "default.${name}"

## `--initial-cluster`

- The initial cluster configuration for bootstrapping
- Default: `"{name}=http://{advertise-peer-url}"`
- For example, if `name` is "pd", and `advertise-peer-urls` is `"http://192.168.100.113:2380"`, the `initial-cluster` is `"pd=http://192.168.100.113:2380"`.
- If you need to start three PD servers, the `initial-cluster` might be:

    ```
    pd1=http://192.168.100.113:2380, pd2=http://192.168.100.114:2380, pd3=192.168.100.115:2380
    ```

## `--join`

- Join the cluster dynamically
- Default: ""
- If you want to join an existing cluster, you can use `--join="${advertise-client-urls}"`, the `advertise-client-url` is any existing PD's, multiply advertise client urls are separated by comma.

## `-L`

- The log level
- Default: "info"
- You can choose from debug, info, warn, error, or fatal.

## `--log-file`

- The log file
- Default: ""
- If this flag is not set, logs will be written to stderr. Otherwise, logs will be stored in the log file which will be automatically rotated every day.

## `--log-rotate`

- To enable or disable log rotation
- Default: true
- When the value is true, follow the `[log.file]` in PD configuration files.

## `--name`

- The human-readable unique name for this PD member
- Default: "pd"
- If you want to start multiply PDs, you must use different name for each one.

## `--cacert`

- The file path of CA, used to enable TLS
- Default: ""

## `--cert`

- The path of the PEM file including the X509 certificate, used to enable TLS
- Default: ""

## `--key`

- The path of the PEM file including the X509 key, used to enable TLS
- Default: ""

## `--namespace-classifier`

- To specify the namespace classifier used by PD
- Default: "table"
- If you use TiKV separately, not in the entire TiDB cluster, it is recommended to configure the value to 'default'.

## `--metrics-addr`

- The address of Prometheus Pushgateway, which does not push data to Promethus by default.
- Default: ""
