### Search progress

In the search progress area, a search on a node is called a search task. A search task might have the following statuses:

- Running: After starting the search, all tasks enter the **Running** status.
- Success: After the task is completed, it automatically enters the **Success** status. At this time, the logs have been cached in the local disk where the Dashboard backend is located, and can be provided to the frontend to download.
- Failed: You have canceled this task, or the task has exited with an error for some reason and enters the **Failed** status. When the task fails, the local temporary files are automatically cleaned.

The search progress area has the following three control buttons:

- **Download Selected**: Click this button to download logs of the selected components (only the completed ones can be selected), and you will get a tar file. Unzip this tar file to get one or more zip files (each component corresponds to a zip file). Unzip the zip file(s) to get the log text file.
- **Cancel**: Click this button to cancel all running tasks. You can click this button only when there are running tasks.
- **Retry**: Click this button to retry all failed tasks. You can click this button only when there are failed tasks and no running tasks.
