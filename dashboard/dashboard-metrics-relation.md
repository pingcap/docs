# TiDB Dashboard Metrics Relation Graph

TiDB Dashboard metrics relation graph is a feature introduced in v4.0.7. This feature presents a relation graph of the monitoring data of each internal process's duration in a TiDB cluster. The aim is to help you quickly understand the duration of each process and their relations.

## Access graph

Log into TiDB Dashboard, click **Cluster Diagnostics** on the left navigation menu, and you can see the page of generating the metrics relation graph.

![Metrics relation graph homepage](/media/dashboard/dashboard-metrics-relation-home.png)

After setting **Range Start Time** and **Range Duration**, click the **Generate Metrics Relation** button and you will enter the page of metrics relation graph.

## Understand graph

The following image is an example of the metrics relation graph. This graph illustrates the proportion of each monitoring metric's duration to the total query duration in a TiDB cluster within 5 minutes after 2020-07-29 16:36:00. The graph also illustrates the relations of each monitoring metric.

For example, the node meaning of the `tidb_execute` monitoring metric is as follows:

+ The total duration of the `tidb_execute` monitoring metric is 19306.46 seconds, which accounts for 89.4% of the total query duration.
+ The duration of the `tidb_execute` node itself is 9070.18 seconds, which accounts for 42% of the total query duration.
+ Hover your mouse over the box area, and you can see the detailed information of the metric, including the total duration, the average duration, and the average P99 (99th percentile) duration.

### Node information

Each box area represents a monitoring metric and provides the following information:

* The name of the monitoring metric
* The total duration of the monitoring metric
* The proportion of the metric's total duration to the total query duration

*The total duration of the metric node* = *the duration of the metric node itself* + *the duration of its child nodes*. Therefore, the metric graph of some nodes displays the proportion of the node itself's duration to the total duration, such as the graph of `tidb_execute`.

![tidb_execute node example1](/media/dashboard/dashboard-metrics-relation-node-example1.png)

* `tidb_execute` is the name of the monitoring metric, which represents the execution duration of a SQL query in the TiDB execution engine.
* `19306.46s` represents that total duration of the `tidb_execute` metric is 19306.46 seconds. `89.40%` represents that 19306.46 seconds account for 89.40% of the total time consumed for all SQL queries (including user SQL queries and TiDB's internal SQL queries). The total query duration is the total duration of `tidb_query`.
* `9070.18s` represents that the total execution duration of the `tidb_execute` node itself is 9070.18 seconds, and the rest is the time consumed by its child nodes. `42.00%` represents that 9070.18 seconds account for 42.00% of the total query duration of all queries.

Hover your mouse over the box area and you can see more details of the `tidb_execute` metric node:

The text information displayed in the image above is the description of the metric node, including the total duration, the total times, the average duration, and the average duration P99, P90, and P80.

### The parent-child relations between nodes

Taking the `tidb_execute` metric node as an example, this section introduces a metric's child nodes.

![tidb_execute node relation example1](/media/dashboard/dashboard-metrics-relation-relation-example1.png)

From the graph above, you can see the two child nodes of `tidb_execute`:

* `pd_start_tso_wait`: The total duration of waiting for the transaction's `start_tso`, which is 300.66 seconds.
* `tidb_txn_cmd`: The total duration of TiDB executing the relevant transaction commands, which is 9935.62 seconds.

In addition, `tidb_execute` also has a dotted arrow pointing to the `tidb_cop` box area, which indicates as follows:

`tidb_execute` includes the duration of the `tidb_cop` metric, but `cop` requests might be executed concurrently. For example, the `execute` duration of performing `join` queries on two tables is 60 seconds, during which table scan requests are concurrently executed on the joined two tables. If the execution durations of `cop` requests are respectively 40 seconds and 30 seconds, the total duration of `cop` requests are 70 seconds. However, the `execute` duration is only 60 seconds. Therefore, if the duration of a parent node does not completely include the duration of a child node, the dotted arrow is used to point to the child node.

> **Note:**
>
> When a node have a dotted arrow pointing to its child node, the duration of this node itself is inaccurate. For example, in the `tidb_execute` node, the duration of the node itself is 9070.18 seconds (`9070.18 = 19306.46 - 300.66 - 9935.62`). In this equation, the duration of the `tidb_cop` child node is not calculated into the duration of `tidb_execute`'s child nodes. But in fact, this is not true. 9070.18 seconds, the duration of `tidb_execute` itself, includes a part of the `tidb_cop` duration, and the duration of this part cannot be determined.

### `tidb_kv_request` and its parent nodes

![tidb_execute node relation example2](/media/dashboard/dashboard-metrics-relation-relation-example2.png)

`tidb_cop` and `tidb_txn_cmd.get`, the parent nodes of `tidb_kv_request`, both have dotted arrows pointing to `tidb_kv_request`, which indicates as follows:

* The duration of `tidb_cop` includes a part of `tidb_kv_request`'s duration.
* The duration of `tidb_txn_cmd.get` also includes a part of `tidb_kv_request`'s duration.

However, it is hard to determine how much duration of `tidb_kv_request` is included in `tidb_cop`.

* `tidb_kv_request.Get`: The duration of TiDB sending the `Get` type key-value requests.
* `tidb_kv_request.Cop`: The duration of TiDB sending the `Cop` type key-value requests.

`tidb_kv_request` does not include `tidb_kv_request.Get` and `tidb_kv_request.Cop` nodes as its child nodes, but consists of the latter two nodes. The name prefix of the child node is the name of the parent node plus `.xxx`, which means that the child node is the sub-class of the parent node. You can understand this case in the following way:

The total duration of TiDB sending key-value requests is 14745.07 seconds, during which the key-value requests for the `Get` and `Cop` types respectively consume 9798.02 seconds and 4946.46 seconds.
