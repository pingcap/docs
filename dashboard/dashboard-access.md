# Access TiDB Dashboard

To access TiDB Dashboard, visit <http://127.0.0.1:2379/dashboard> via your browser. Replace `127.0.0.1:2379` with the actual PD instance address and port.

If multiple PD instances are deployed in your cluster and you can directly access **every** PD instance and port, you can simply replace `127.0.0.1:2379` in the <http://127.0.0.1:2379/dashboard/> address with **any** PD instance address and port.

> **Note:**
>
> If a firewall or reverse proxy is configured and you cannot directly access every PD instance, you might not be able to access TiDB Dashboard. Usually, this is because the firewall or reverse proxy is not correctly configured. See [Use TiDB Dashboard behind Reverse Proxy](/dashboard/dashboard-ops-reverse-proxy.md) and [Secure TiDB Dashboard](/dashboard/dashboard-ops-security.md) to learn correctly configure the firewall or reverse proxy when multiple PD instances are deployed.

## Browser compatibility

You can use TiDB Dashboard in the following common desktop browsers of a relatively newer version:

- Chrome >= 77
- Firefox >= 68
- Edge >= 17

> **Note:**
>
> If you use the browsers above of earlier versions or other browsers to access TiDB Dashboard, some functions might not work properly.

## Sign in
