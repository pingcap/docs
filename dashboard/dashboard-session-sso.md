# Configure SSO for TiDB Dashboard

TiDB Dashboard supports [OIDC](https://openid.net/connect/)-based Single Sign-On (SSO). After enabling the SSO feature of TiDB Dashboard, the configured SSO service is used for your sign-in authentication and then you can access TiDB Dashboard without entering the SQL user password.

## Configure OIDC SSO

> **Note:**
>
> This feature is available only in clusters of v5.1.1 or later.

### Enable SSO

1. Sign into TiDB Dashboard.

2. Click the username in the left sidebar to access the configuration page.

3. In the **Single Sign-On** section, select **Enable to use SSO when sign into TiDB Dashboard**.

4. Fill the **OIDC Client ID** and the **OIDC Discovery URL** fields in the form.

   Generally, you can obtain the two fields from the SSO service provider:

   - OIDC Client ID is also called OIDC Token Issuer.
   - OIDC Discovery URL is also called OIDC Token Audience.

5. Click **Authorize Impersonation** and input the SQL password.

   TiDB Dashboard will store this SQL password and use it to impersonate a normal SQL sign-in after an SSO sign-in is finished.

   > **Note:**
   >
   > The password you have entered will be encrypted and stored. The SSO sign-in will fail after the password of the SQL user is changed. In this case, you can re-enter the password to bring SSO back.

6. Click **Authorize and Save**.

Now SSO sign-in has been enabled for TiDB Dashboard.

> **Note:**
>
> For security reasons, some SSO services require additional configuration for the SSO service, such as the trusted sign-in and sign-out URIs. Refer to the documentation of the SSO service for further information.

### Disable SSO

You can disable the SSO, which will completely erase the stored SQL password:

1. Sign into TiDB Dashboard.

2. Click the username in the left sidebar to access the configuration page.

3. In the **Single Sign-On** section, deselect **Enable to use SSO when sign into TiDB Dashboard**.

4. Click **Update** (Update) to save the configuration.

   ![Sample Step](/media/dashboard/dashboard-session-sso-disable.png)

### Re-enter the password after a password change

The SSO sign-in will fail once the password of the SQL user is changed. In this case, you can bring back the SSO sign-in by re-entering the SQL password:

1. Sign into TiDB Dashboard.

2. Click the username in the left sidebar to access the configuration page.

3. In the **Single Sign-On** section, Click **Authorize Impersonation** and input the updated SQL password.

4. Click **Authorize and Save**.

2. Sign into the system with SSO service configured.

3. You are redirected back to TiDB Dashboard to finish the sign-in.

## Example: Use Okta for TiDB Dashboard SSO sign-in

[Okta](https://www.okta.com/) is an OIDC SSO identity service, which is compatible with the SSO feature of TiDB Dashboard. The steps below demonstrate how to configure Okta and TiDB Dashboard so that Okta can be used as the TiDB Dashboard SSO provider.

### Step 1: Configure Okta

First, create an Okta Application Integration to integrate SSO.

1. Access the Okta administration site.

2. Navigate from the left sidebar **Applications** > **Applications**.

3. Click **Create App Integration**ã€‚

   ![Sample Step](/media/dashboard/dashboard-session-sso-okta-1.png)

4. In the poped up dialog, choose **OIDC - OpenID Connect** in **Sign-in method**.

5. Choose **Single-Page Application** in **Application Type**.

6. Click the **Next** button.

   ![Sample Step](/media/dashboard/dashboard-session-sso-okta-2.png)

7. Fill **Sign-in redirect URIs** as follows:

   ```
   http://DASHBOARD_IP:PORT/dashboard/?sso_callback=1
   ```

   Substitute `DASHBOARD_IP:PORT` with the actual domain (or IP address) and port that you use to access the TiDB Dashboard in the browser.

8. Fill **Sign-out redirect URIs** as follows:

   ```
   http://DASHBOARD_IP:PORT/dashboard/
   ```

   Similarly, substitute `DASHBOARD_IP:PORT` with the actual domain (or IP address) and port.

   ![Sample Step](/media/dashboard/dashboard-session-sso-okta-3.png)

9. Configure what type of users in your organization is allowed for SSO sign-in in the **Assignments** field, and then click **Save** to save the configuration.

   ![Sample Step](/media/dashboard/dashboard-session-sso-okta-4.png)

### Step 2: Obtain OIDC information and fill in TiDB Dashboard

1. In the Application Integration just created in Okta, click **Sign On**.

   ![Sample Step 1](/media/dashboard/dashboard-session-sso-okta-info-1.png)

2. Copy values of the **Issuer** and **Audience** fields from the **OpenID Connect ID Token** section.

   ![Sample Step 2](/media/dashboard/dashboard-session-sso-okta-info-2.png)

3. Open the TiDB Dashboard configuration page, fill **OIDC Client ID** with **Issuer** obtained from the last step and fill **OIDC Discovery URL** with **Audience**. Then finish the authorization and save the configuration. For example:

   ![Sample Step 3](/media/dashboard/dashboard-session-sso-okta-info-3.png)

Now TiDB Dashboard has been configured to use Okta SSO for sign-in.
