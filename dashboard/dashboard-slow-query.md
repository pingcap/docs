title: Slow Queries Page of TiDB Dashboard
summary: TiDB Dashboard's Slow Queries page allows users to search and view slow queries in the cluster. Queries with an execution time over 300 milliseconds are considered slow. Users can adjust the threshold and access the page through the dashboard or a browser. They can also change filters, display more columns, export queries, and view execution details.

# Slow Queries Page of TiDB Dashboard

On the Slow Queries page of TiDB Dashboard, you can search and view all slow queries in the cluster.

By default, SQL queries with an execution time of more than 300 milliseconds are considered as slow queries. These queries are recorded in the [slow query logs](/identify-slow-queries.md) and can be searched via TiDB Dashboard. You can adjust the threshold of slow queries through the [`tidb_slow_log_threshold`](/system-variables.md#tidb_slow_log_threshold) session variable or the [`instance.tidb_slow_log_threshold`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#tidb_slow_log_threshold) TiDB parameter.

> **Note:**
>
> If the slow query log is disabled, this feature will be unavailable. The slow query log is enabled by default, and you can enable or disable it through the system variable [`tidb_enable_slow_log`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_slow_log).

## Access the page

You can use one of the following two methods to access the slow query page:

* After logging in to TiDB Dashboard, click **Slow Queries** in the left navigation menu.

* Visit <http://127.0.0.1:2379/dashboard/#/slow_query> in your browser. Replace `127.0.0.1:2379` with the actual PD address and port.

All data displayed on the slow query page comes from TiDB slow query system tables and slow query logs. See [slow query logs](/identify-slow-queries.md) for details.

### Change filters

You can filter slow queries based on the time range, the related database, SQL keywords, SQL types, the number of slow queries to be displayed. In the image below, 100 slow queries over the recent 30 minutes are displayed by default.

### Display more columns

Click **Columns** on the page and you can choose to see more columns. You can move your mouse to the **(i)** icon at the right side of a column name to view the description of this column:

![Show more columns](/media/dashboard/dashboard-slow-queries-list2-v620.png)

### Export slow queries locally

Click â˜° (**More**) in the upper-right corner of the page to display the **Export** option. After you click **Export**, TiDB Dashboard exports slow queries in the current list as a CSV file.

### Sort by column

By default, the list is sorted by **Finish Time** in the descending order. Click column headings to sort by the column or switch the sorting order:

![Modify sorting basis](/media/dashboard/dashboard-slow-queries-list3-v620.png)

## View execution details

Click any item in the list to display detailed execution information of the slow query, including:

- Query: The text of the SQL statement (area 1 in the following figure)
- Plan: The execution plan of the slow query (area 2 in the following figure)
- Other sorted SQL execution information (area 3 in the following figure)

### SQL

> **Note:**
>
> The maximum length of the query recorded in the `Query` column is limited by the [`tidb_stmt_summary_max_sql_length`](/system-variables.md#tidb_stmt_summary_max_sql_length-new-in-v40) system variable.

Click the **Expand** button to view the detailed information of an item. Click the **Copy** button to copy the detailed information to the clipboard.

### Execution plans

On TiDB Dashboard, you can view execution plans in three ways: table, text, and graph. To learn how to read an execution plan, see [Understand the query execution plan](/explain-overview.md).

#### Execution plan in table format

The table format provides detailed information about the execution plan, which helps you quickly identify abnormal operator metrics and compare the status of different operators. The following figure shows an execution plan in table format:

![Execution plan in table format](/media/dashboard/dashboard-table-plan.png)

The table format displays similar information to the text format but provides more user-friendly interactions:

- You can adjust the column width freely.
- When content exceeds the column width, it is automatically truncated and a tooltip is shown for the full information.
- If the execution plan is large, you can download it as a text file for local analysis.
- You can hide and manage columns using the column picker.

#### Execution plan in graph format

The graph format is more suitable for viewing the execution plan tree of a complex SQL statement and understanding each operator and its corresponding content in detail. The following figure shows an execution plan in graph format:

![Execution plan in graph format](/media/dashboard/dashboard-visual-plan-2.png)

- The graph shows the execution from left to right, and from top to bottom.
- Upper nodes are parent operators and lower nodes are child operators.
- The color of the title bar indicates the component where the operator is executed: yellow stands for TiDB, blue stands for TiKV, and pink stands for TiFlash.
- The title bar shows the operator name and the text shown below is the basic information of the operator.

Click the node area, and the detailed operator information is displayed on the right sidebar.

### SQL execution details

For basic information, execution time, Coprocessor read, transaction, and slow query of the SQL statement, you can click the corresponding tab titles to switch among different information.

![Show different execution information](/media/dashboard/dashboard-slow-queries-detail2-v620.png)

#### Basic tab

The basic information of a SQL execution includes the table names, index name, execution count, and total latency. The **Description** column provides detailed description of each field.

![Basic information](/media/dashboard/dashboard-slow-queries-detail-plans-basic.png)

#### Time tab

Click the **Time** tab, and you can see how long each stage of the execution plan lasts.

> **Note:**
>
> Because some operations might be performed in parallel within a single SQL statement, the cumulative duration of each stage might exceed the actual execution time of the SQL statement.

![Execution time](/media/dashboard/dashboard-slow-queries-detail-plans-time.png)

#### Coprocessor tab

Click the **Coprocessor** tab, and you can see information related to Coprocessor read.

![Coprocessor read](/media/dashboard/dashboard-slow-queries-detail-plans-cop-read.png)

#### Transaction tab

Click the **Transaction** tab, and you can see information related to execution plans and transactions, such as the average number of written keys or the maximum number of written keys.
