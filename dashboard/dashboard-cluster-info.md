title: TiDB Dashboard Cluster Information Page
summary: The TiDB Dashboard Cluster Information Page allows users to view the running status of TiDB, TiKV, PD, and TiFlash components in the entire cluster, as well as the running status of the host on which these components are located. Users can access the page by logging in to TiDB Dashboard and clicking on Cluster Info in the left navigation menu, or by visiting a specific URL in their browser. The page provides instance, host, and disk lists, showing detailed information about each component and its running status.

# TiDB Dashboard Cluster Information Page

On the cluster information page, you can view the running status of TiDB, TiKV, PD, TiFlash components in the entire cluster and the running status of the host on which these components are located.

## Access the page

You can use one of the following two methods to access the cluster information page:

* After logging in to TiDB Dashboard, click **Cluster Info** in the left navigation menu.

* Visit <http://127.0.0.1:2379/dashboard/#/cluster_info/instance> in your browser. Replace `127.0.0.1:2379` with the actual PD instance address and port.

## Instance list

Click **Instances** to view the list of instances:

![Instance list](/media/dashboard/dashboard-cluster-info-instances-v650.png)

This instance list shows the overview information of all instances of TiDB, TiKV, PD, and TiFlash components in the cluster.

The list includes the following information:

- Address: The instance address.
- Status: The running status of the instance.
- Up Time: The start time of the instance.
- Version: The instance version number.
- Git Hash: The Git Hash value corresponding to the instance binary file.
- Deployment directory: The directory in which the instance binary file is located.

### Instance status

An instance can run in one of the following statuses:

- Up: The instance is running normally.
- Down or Unreachable: The instance is not running or a network problem exists on the corresponding host.
- Tombstone: The data on the instance has been completely migrated out and the scaling-in is complete. This status exists only on TiKV or TiFlash instances.
- Leaving: The data on the instance is being migrated out and the scaling-in is in process. This status exists only on TiKV or TiFlash instances.
- Unknown: The running state of the instance is unknown.

> **Note:**
>
> - `Leaving` in TiDB Dashboard, `Offline` returned by PD API, and `Pending Offline` in TiUP indicate the same status.
> - Some columns in the table can be displayed only when the instance is up.

Instance status derives from the PD scheduling information. For more details, see [Information collection](/tidb-scheduling.md#information-collection).

## Host list

Click **Hosts** to view the list of hosts:

![Host list](/media/dashboard/dashboard-cluster-info-hosts-v650.png)

This host list shows the running status of hosts that correspond to all instances of TiDB, TiKV, PD, and TiFlash components in the cluster.

The list includes the following information:

- Host Address: The Host IP address.
- CPU: The number of logical cores of the host CPU.
- CPU Usage: The user-mode and kernel-mode CPU usage in the current 1 second.
- Memory: The total physical memory size of the host.
- Memory Usage: The current memory usage of the host.

> **Note:**
>
> The host list information is provided by each instance process, so when all instances on the host are down, the host information is not displayed.

## Disk list

Click **Disks** to view the list of disks:

![Disk list](/media/dashboard/dashboard-cluster-info-disks-v650.png)

This disk list shows the status of disks on which the TiDB, TiKV, PD, and TiFlash instances run.

The list includes the following information:

- Host Address: The Host IP address.
- Mount Directory: The mount path of this disk on the host on which the instance is running.
- File System: The file system type of this disk on the host on which the instance is running.
- Disk Capacity: The total space of the disk on the host on which the instance is running.
- Disk Usage: The space usage of the disk on the host on which the instance is running.
- Instance: The instance running on this host.
