# Console Audit Logging

TiDB Cloud provides the console audit logging feature to help you track various behaviors and operations of users on the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com). For example, you can track operations, such as inviting a user to join your organization and creating a cluster.

## Prerequisites

- You must be in the `Organization Owner` or `Organization Console Audit Admin` role of your organization in TiDB Cloud. Otherwise, you cannot see the console audit logging-related options in the TiDB Cloud console.
- You can only enable and disable the console audit logging for your organization. You can only track the actions of users in your organization.
- After the console audit logging is enabled, all event types of the TiDB Cloud console will be audited, and you cannot specify only auditing some of them.

## Enable console audit logging

The console audit logging feature is disabled by default. To enable it, take the following steps:

1. In the lower-left corner of the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com/), click <MDSvgIcon name="icon-top-organization" />, and then click **Console Audit Logging**.
2. Click **Settings** in the upper-right corner, and then enable console audit logging.

## Disable console audit logging

To disable console audit logging, take the following steps:

1. In the lower-left corner of the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com/), click <MDSvgIcon name="icon-top-organization" />, and then click **Console Audit Logging**.
2. Click **Settings** in the upper-right corner, and then disable console audit logging.

## View console audit logs

You can only view the console audit logs of your organization.

> **Note:**
>
> - If it is the first time your organization enables console audit logging, the console audit logs are empty. After any audited events are performed, you will see the corresponding logs.
> - If it has been more than 90 days since console audit logging was disabled, you cannot see any logs.

1. In the lower-left corner of the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com/), click <MDSvgIcon name="icon-top-organization" />, and then click **Console Audit Logging**.
2. To get a specific part of audit logs, you can filter the event type, operation status, and time range.
3. (Optional) To filter more fields, click **Advanced filter**, add more filters, and then click **Apply**.
4. Click the row of a log to view its detailed information in the right pane.

## Export console audit logs

To export the console audit logs of your organization, take the following step:

1. In the lower-left corner of the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com/), click <MDSvgIcon name="icon-top-organization" />, and then click **Console Audit Logging**.
2. (Optional) If you need to export a specific part of console audit logs, you can filter through various conditions. Otherwise, skip this step.
3. Click **Export** and select the desired export format in JSON or CSV.

## Console audit log storage policy

The storage time of console audit logs is 90 days, after which the logs will be automatically cleaned up.

> **Note:**
>
> - You cannot specify the storage location of console audit logs in TiDB Cloud.
> - You cannot manually delete audit logs.

## Console audit event types

The console audit logs record various user activities on the TiDB Cloud console through event types.

> **Note:**
>
> Currently, most event types on the TiDB Cloud console can be audited, and you can find them in the following table. For the remaining event types that are not covered yet, TiDB Cloud will continuously work on including them as well.
