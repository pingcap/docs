# TiDB Cloud Introduction

[TiDB Cloud](https://www.pingcap.com/tidb-cloud/) is a fully-managed Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) that brings [TiDB](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/overview), an open-source Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) database, to your cloud. TiDB Cloud offers an easy way to deploy and manage databases to let you focus on your applications, not the complexities of the databases. You can create TiDB Cloud clusters to quickly build mission-critical applications on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Architecture

![TiDB Cloud architecture](/media/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-architecture.png)

- TiDB VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

    For each TiDB Cloud cluster, all TiDB nodes and auxiliary nodes, including TiDB Operator nodes, logging nodes, and so on, are deployed in an independent VPC.

- TiDB Cloud Central Services

    Central Services, including billing, alerts, meta storage, dashboard UI, are deployed independently. You can access the dashboard UI to operate the TiDB cluster via the internet.

- Your VPC

    You can connect to your TiDB cluster via private endpoint connection or VPC peering connection. Refer to [Set Up Private Endpoint Connections](/tidb-cloud/set-up-private-endpoint-connections.md) or [Set up VPC Peering Connection](/tidb-cloud/set-up-vpc-peering-connections.md) for details.
