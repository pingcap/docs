# Delete a {{{ .premium }}} instance

This document describes how to delete a {{{ .premium }}} instance.

You can delete an instance at any time by performing the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [**TiDB Instances**](https://tidbcloud.com/tidbs) page.
2. In the row of your target instance to be deleted, click **...**.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > Alternatively, you can also click the name of the target instance to go to its overview page, and then click **...** in the upper-right corner.

3. Click **Delete** in the drop-down menu.
4. In the deletion confirmation window, confirm the deletion:

    Enter `<organization name>/<instance name>` to ensure the instance is deleted correctly.

    If you want to restore the instance some time in the future, make sure that you have a backup of the instance. Otherwise, you cannot restore it. For more information about how to back up {{{ .premium }}} instances, see [Back Up and Restore {{{ .premium }}} Data](/tidb-cloud/premium/backup-and-restore-premium.md).

5. Click **I understand, delete it**.

    Once you delete a backed up {{{ .premium }}} instance, the existing backup files of the instance are moved to the recycle bin.

    Automatic backups will expire and be automatically deleted once the retention period ends. The default retention period is 7 days if you don't modify it.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > Please be aware that backups will continue to incur charges until deleted.

    If you want to restore a {{{ .premium }}} instance from the recycle bin, see [Restore from Recycle Bin](/tidb-cloud/premium/backup-and-restore-premium.md#restore-from-recycle-bin).
