# Identity Access Management for {{{ .premium }}}

This document describes how to manage user access, roles, and permissions across organizations and TiDB instances in {{{ .premium }}}.

Before you can use TiDB Cloud, [sign up for an account](https://tidbcloud.com/free-trial). You can either sign up with email and password to [manage your password in TiDB Cloud](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-password-authentication.md), or choose your Google, GitHub, or Microsoft account for single sign-on (SSO) to TiDB Cloud.

## Organizations and TiDB instances

{{{ .premium }}} uses a hierarchical structure of organizations and instances to help you manage users and TiDB instances efficiently. As an `Organization Owner`, you can create and manage multiple instances within your organization.

For example:

```
- Your organization
    - TiDB instance 1
    - TiDB instance 2
    - TiDB instance 3
    ...
```

In this structure:

- Users can access an organization only if they are members of it.
- To access a TiDB instance, users need at least read permissions for that instance in the organization.

For more information about user roles and permissions, see [User Roles](#user-roles).

### Organizations

An organization can include multiple TiDB instances.

TiDB Cloud calculates billing at the organization level, with the billing details available for each instance.

If you are an `Organization Owner`, you have full administrative privileges in your organization.

For example, you can do the following:

- Create TiDB instances for different purposes.
- Assign organization-level and instance-level roles to different users.
- Configure organization-wide settings such as time zone.

### TiDB instances

If you are an `Instance Administrator`, you can manage settings and operations for a specific instance.

For example, you can do the following:

- Delete a TiDB instance when it is no longer needed.
- Modify instance configurations as needed.

## User roles

TiDB Cloud defines different user roles to control permissions at both the organization and TiDB instance levels.

You can grant roles to users at the organization level or at the TiDB instance level. It is recommended to plan your hierarchy carefully to ensure least‑privilege access and maintain security.

### Organization roles

At the organization level, TiDB Cloud defines the following roles, in which `Organization Owner` can invite members and grant organization roles to members.

| Permission  | `Organization Owner` | `Organization Billing Manager` | `Organization Billing Viewer` | `Organization Console Audit Manager` | `Organization Viewer` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Manage organization settings, such as TiDB instances, API keys, and time zones. | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Add or remove organization members, and edit organization roles. | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `Instance Administrator` permissions for all TiDB instances in the organization. | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manage payment information for the organization. | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View billing and use [Cost Explorer](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-billing.md#cost-explorer). | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manage [console audit logging](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-console-auditing.md) for the organization. | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| View all organization members. | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View organization name and time zone. | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

> **Note:**
>
> - The `Organization Console Audit Manager` role manages audit logging in the TiDB Cloud console only, not database audit logging.

### TiDB instance roles

At the TiDB instance level, TiDB Cloud defines two roles: `Instance Administrator` and `Instance Viewer`.

> **Note:**
>
> - The `Organization Owner` automatically inherits all `Instance Administrator` permissions for every instance in the organization.
> - Each TiDB instance role inherits all the permissions of the `Organization Viewer` role by default.
> - If a member in your organization does not have any TiDB instance roles, the member cannot access any TiDB instances in your organization.

| Permission  | `Instance Administrator` | `Instance Viewer` |
|---|---|---|
| Manage TiDB instance settings | ✅ | ❌ |
| Manage [database audit logging](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-auditing.md) of the TiDB instance. | ✅ | ❌ |
| Manage TiDB instance operations, such as TiDB instance creation, modification, and deletion. | ✅ | ❌ |
| Manage TiDB instance data, such as data import, data backup and restore, and data migration. | ✅ | ❌ |
| Manage [changefeeds](/tidb-cloud/changefeed-overview.md). | ✅ | ❌ |
| Review and reset the root password for the TiDB instance. | ✅ | ❌ |
| View the overview, backup records, metrics, events, and [changefeeds](/tidb-cloud/changefeed-overview.md) of the TiDB instance. | ✅ | ✅ |

## Manage organization access

### View and switch between organizations

To view and switch between organizations, take the following steps:

1. In the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com), click the combo box in the upper-left corner. The list of organizations you belong to is displayed.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > - If you are currently on the page of a specific TiDB instance, after clicking the combo box in the upper-left corner, you also need to click ← in the combo box to return to the organization list.
    > - If you are a member of multiple organizations, you can click the target organization name in the combo box to switch your account between organizations.

2. To view the detailed information of your organization, such as the organization ID and time zone, click the organization name, and then click **Organization Settings** > **General** in the left navigation pane.

### Set the time zone for your organization

If you are in the `Organization Owner` role, you can modify the system display time according to your time zone.

    > - The default role at the organization level is `Organization Viewer`.
    > - If you want to invite multiple users at one time, you can enter multiple email addresses.
    > - The invited user does not have access to any TiDB instances by default. To grant TiDB instance permissions to the user, see [Invite a user to access or manage a TiDB instance](#invite-a-user-to-access-or-manage-a-tidb-instance).

5. If you only need to assign the user an organization role and do not need to assign any project or TiDB instance roles, disable the **Add access for projects and instances** option.

6. Click **Invite**. Then the new user is successfully added into the user list. At the same time, an email is sent to the invited email address with a verification link.

7. After receiving this email, the user needs to click the link in the email to verify the identity, and a new page shows.

8. If the invited email address has not been used to sign up for a TiDB Cloud account, the user is directed to the sign-up page to create an account.
