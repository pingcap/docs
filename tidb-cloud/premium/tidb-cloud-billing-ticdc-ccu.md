# Changefeed Billing for {{{ .premium }}}

This document describes the billing details for changefeeds in {{{ .premium }}}.

## CCU cost

{{{ .premium }}} measures the capacity of [changefeeds](/tidb-cloud/changefeed-overview.md) in TiCDC Changefeed Capacity Units (CCUs). When you [create a changefeed](/tidb-cloud/changefeed-overview.md#create-a-changefeed) for an instance, you can select an appropriate specification.
