# Import CSV Files from Cloud Storage into {{{ .premium }}}

This document describes how to import CSV files from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS) into {{{ .premium }}} instances.

> **Warning:**
>
> {{{ .premium }}} is currently available in **private preview** in select AWS regions.
>
> If Premium is not yet enabled for your organization, or if you need access in another cloud provider or region, click **Support** in the lower-left corner of the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com/), or submit a request through the [Contact Us](https://www.pingcap.com/contact-us) form on the website.

> - For {{{ .dedicated }}}, see [Import CSV Files from Cloud Storage into {{{ .dedicated }}}](/tidb-cloud/import-csv-files.md).

## Limitations

To ensure data consistency, {{{ .premium }}} allows importing CSV files into empty tables only. To import data into an existing table that already contains data, you can import the data into a temporary empty table by following this document, and then use the `INSERT SELECT` statement to copy the data to the target existing table.

## Step 1. Prepare the CSV files

1. If a CSV file is larger than 256 MiB, consider splitting it into smaller files, each with a size around 256 MiB.

    {{{ .premium }}} supports importing very large CSV files but performs best with multiple input files around 256 MiB in size. This is because {{{ .premium }}} can process multiple files in parallel, which can greatly improve the import speed.

2. Name the CSV files as follows:

    - If a CSV file contains all data of an entire table, name the file in the `${db_name}.${table_name}.csv` format, which maps to the `${db_name}.${table_name}` table when you import the data.
    - If the data of one table is separated into multiple CSV files, append a numeric suffix to these CSV files. For example, `${db_name}.${table_name}.000001.csv` and `${db_name}.${table_name}.000002.csv`. The numeric suffixes can be non-consecutive but must be in ascending order. You also need to add extra zeros before the number to ensure that all suffixes have the same length.
    - {{{ .premium }}} supports importing compressed files in the following formats: `.gzip`, `.gz`, `.zstd`, `.zst` and `.snappy`. If you want to import compressed CSV files, name the files in the `${db_name}.${table_name}.${suffix}.csv.${compress}` format, where `${suffix}` is optional and can be any integer such as '000001'. For example, if you want to import the `trips.000001.csv.gz` file to the `bikeshare.trips` table, you need to rename the file as `bikeshare.trips.000001.csv.gz`.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > - To achieve better performance, it is recommended to limit the size of each compressed file to 100 MiB.
    > - The Snappy compressed file must be in the [official Snappy format](https://github.com/google/snappy). Other variants of Snappy compression are not supported.
    > - For uncompressed files, if you cannot update the CSV filenames according to the preceding rules in some cases (for example, the CSV file links are also used by your other programs), you can keep the filenames unchanged and use the **Mapping Settings** in [Step 4](#step-4-import-csv-files) to import your source data to a single target table.

## Step 2. Create the target table schemas

Because CSV files do not contain schema information, before importing data from CSV files into {{{ .premium }}}, you need to create the table schemas using either of the following methods:

- Method 1: In {{{ .premium }}}, create the target databases and tables for your source data.

- Method 2: In the Amazon S3 or Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS) directory where the CSV files are located, create the target table schema files for your source data as follows:

    1. Create database schema files for your source data.

        If your CSV files follow the naming rules in [Step 1](#step-1-prepare-the-csv-files), the database schema files are optional for the data import. Otherwise, the database schema files are mandatory.

        Each database schema file must be in the `${db_name}-schema-create.sql` format and contain a `CREATE DATABASE` DDL statement. With this file, {{{ .premium }}} will create the `${db_name}` database to store your data when you import the data.

        For example, if you create a `mydb-schema-create.sql` file that contains the following statement, {{{ .premium }}} will create the `mydb` database when you import the data.

        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE mydb;
        ```

    2. Create table schema files for your source data.

        If you do not include the table schema files in the Amazon S3 or Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service directory where the CSV files are located, {{{ .premium }}} will not create the corresponding tables for you when you import the data.

        Each table schema file must be in the `${db_name}.${table_name}-schema.sql` format and contain a `CREATE TABLE` DDL statement. With this file, {{{ .premium }}} will create the `${table_name}` table in the `${db_name}` database when you import the data.

        For example, if you create a `mydb.mytable-schema.sql` file that contains the following statement, {{{ .premium }}} will create the `mytable` table in the `mydb` database when you import the data.

        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE mytable (
        ID INT,
        REGION VARCHAR(20),
        COUNT INT );
        ```

        > **Note:**
        >
        > Each `${db_name}.${table_name}-schema.sql` file should only contain a single DDL statement. If the file contains multiple DDL statements, only the first one takes effect.

## Step 3. Configure cross-account access

To allow {{{ .premium }}} to access the CSV files in Amazon S3 or Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS), do one of the following:

- If your CSV files are located in Amazon S3, [configure Amazon S3 access](/tidb-cloud/serverless-external-storage.md#configure-amazon-s3-access) for your TiDB instance.

    You can use either an AWS access key or a Role ARN to access your bucket. Once finished, make a note of the access key (including the access key ID and secret access key) or the Role ARN value as you will need it in [Step 4](#step-4-import-csv-files).

- If your CSV files are located in Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS), [configure Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS) access](/tidb-cloud/serverless-external-storage.md#configure-alibaba-cloud-object-storage-service-oss-access) for your TiDB instance.

## Step 4. Import CSV files

To import the CSV files to {{{ .premium }}}, take the following steps:

<SimpleTab>
<div label="Amazon S3">

1. Open the **Import** page for your target TiDB instance.

    1. Log in to the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com/) and navigate to the [**TiDB Instances**](https://tidbcloud.com/tidbs) page.

        > **Tip:**
        >
        > You can use the combo box in the upper-left corner to switch between organizations and instances.

    2. Click the name of your target TiDB instance to go to its overview page, and then click **Data** > **Import** in the left navigation pane.

2. Click **Import data from Cloud Storage**.

3. On the **Import Data from Cloud Storage** page, provide the following information:

    - **Storage Provider**: select **Amazon S3**.
    - **Source Files URI**:
        - When importing one file, enter the source file URI in the following format `s3://[bucket_name]/[data_source_folder]/[file_name].csv`. For example, `s3://sampledata/ingest/TableName.01.csv`.
        - When importing multiple files, enter the source folder URI in the following format `s3://[bucket_name]/[data_source_folder]/`. For example, `s3://sampledata/ingest/`.
    - **Credential**: you can use either an AWS Role ARN or an AWS access key to access your bucket. For more information, see [Configure Amazon S3 access](/tidb-cloud/serverless-external-storage.md#configure-amazon-s3-access).
        - **AWS Role ARN**: enter the AWS Role ARN value. If you need to create a new role, click **Click here to create a new one with AWS CloudFormation** and follow the guided steps to launch the provided template, acknowledge the IAM warning, create the stack, and copy the generated ARN back into {{{ .premium }}}.
        - **AWS Access Key**: enter the AWS access key ID and AWS secret access key.
    - **Test Bucket Access**: click this button after the credentials are in place to confirm that {{{ .premium }}} can reach the bucket.
    - **Target Connection**: provide the TiDB username and password that will run the import. Optionally, click **Test Connection** to validate the credentials.

4. Click **Next**.

5. In the **Source Files Mapping** section, {{{ .premium }}} scans the bucket and proposes mappings between the source files and destination tables.

    When a directory is specified in **Source Files URI**, the **Use [File naming conventions](/tidb-cloud/naming-conventions-for-data-import.md) for automatic mapping** option is selected by default.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > When a single file is specified in **Source Files URI**, the **Use [File naming conventions](/tidb-cloud/naming-conventions-for-data-import.md) for automatic mapping** option is not displayed, and {{{ .premium }}} automatically populates the **Source** field with the file name. In this case, you only need to select the target database and table for data import.

    - Leave automatic mapping enabled to apply the [file naming conventions](/tidb-cloud/naming-conventions-for-data-import.md) to your source files and target tables. Keep **CSV** selected as the data format.

    - **Advanced options**: expand the panel to view the `Ignore compatibility checks (advanced)` toggle. Leave it disabled unless you intentionally want to bypass schema compatibility validation.

    <!-- future feature -->
    > **Note:**
    >
    > Manual mapping is coming soon. When the toggle becomes available, clear the automatic mapping option and configure the mapping manually:
    >
    > - **Source**: enter a filename pattern such as `TableName.01.csv`. Wildcards `*` and `?` are supported (for example, `my-data*.csv`).
    > - **Target Database** and **Target Table**: choose the destination objects for the matched files.

6. {{{ .premium }}} automatically scans the source path. Review the scan results, check the data files found and corresponding target tables, and then click **Start Import**.

7. When the import progress shows **Completed**, check the imported tables.

6. {{{ .premium }}} automatically scans the source path. Review the scan results, check the data files found and corresponding target tables, and then click **Start Import**.

7. When the import progress shows **Completed**, check the imported tables.

</div>

</SimpleTab>

When you run an import task, if any unsupported or invalid conversions are detected, {{{ .premium }}} terminates the import job automatically and reports an importing error.

If you get an importing error, do the following:

1. Drop the partially imported table.
2. Check the table schema file. If there are any errors, correct the table schema file.
3. Check the data types in the CSV files.
4. Try the import task again.

## Troubleshooting

### Resolve warnings during data import

After clicking **Start Import**, if you see a warning message such as `can't find the corresponding source files`, resolve this by providing the correct source file, renaming the existing one according to [Naming Conventions for Data Import](/tidb-cloud/naming-conventions-for-data-import.md), or using **Advanced Settings** to make changes.

After resolving these issues, you need to import the data again.

### Zero rows in the imported tables

After the import progress shows **Completed**, check the imported tables. If the number of rows is zero, it means no data files matched the Bucket URI that you entered. In this case, resolve this issue by providing the correct source file, renaming the existing one according to [Naming Conventions for Data Import](/tidb-cloud/naming-conventions-for-data-import.md), or using **Advanced Settings** to make changes. After that, import those tables again.
