# Identity Access Management

This document describes how to manage access to organizations, projects, roles, and user profiles in TiDB Cloud.

Before accessing TiDB Cloud, [create a TiDB Cloud account](https://tidbcloud.com/free-trial). You can either sign up with email and password so that you can [manage your password using TiDB Cloud](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-password-authentication.md), or choose your Google, GitHub, or Microsoft account for single sign-on (SSO) to TiDB Cloud.

## Organizations and projects

TiDB Cloud provides a hierarchical structure based on organizations and projects to facilitate the management of TiDB Cloud users and clusters. If you are an organization owner, you can create multiple projects in your organization.

For example:

```
- Your organization
    - Project 1
        - Cluster 1
        - Cluster 2
    - Project 2
        - Cluster 3
        - Cluster 4
    - Project 3
        - Cluster 5
        - Cluster 6
```

Under this structure:

- To access an organization, a user must be a member of that organization.
- To access a project in an organization, a user must at least have the read access to the project in that organization.
- To manage clusters in a project, a user must be in the `Project Owner` role.

For more information about user roles and permissions, see [User Roles](#user-roles).

### Organizations

An organization can contain multiple projects.

TiDB Cloud calculates billing at the organization level and provides the billing details for each project.

If you are an organization owner, you have the highest permission in your organization.

For example, you can do the following:

- Create different projects (such as development, staging, and production) for different purposes.
- Assign different users with different organization roles and project roles.
- Configure organization settings. For example, configure the time zone for your organization.

### Projects

A project can contain multiple clusters.

If you are a project owner, you can manage clusters and project settings for your project.

For example, you can do the following:

- Create multiple clusters according to your business need.
- Assign different users with different project roles.
- Configure project settings. For example, configure different alert settings for different projects.

## User roles

TiDB Cloud defines different user roles to manage different permissions of TiDB Cloud users in organizations, projects, or both.

You can grant roles to a user at the organization level or at the project level. Make sure to carefully plan the hierarchy of your organizations and projects for security considerations.

### Organization roles

At the organization level, TiDB Cloud defines four roles, in which `Organization Owner` can invite members and grant organization roles to members.

| Permission  | `Organization Owner` | `Organization Billing Admin` | `Organization Console Audit Admin` | `Organization Member` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Manage organization settings, such as projects, API keys, and time zones. | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Invite users to or remove users from an organization, and edit organization roles of users. | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| All the permissions of `Project Owner` for all projects in the organization. | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Create projects with Customer-Managed Encryption Key (CMEK) enabled | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View bills and edit payment information for the organization. | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manage TiDB Cloud [console audit logging](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-console-auditing.md) for the organization. | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| View users in the organization and projects in which the member belong to. | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

> **Note:**
>
> The `Organization Console Audit Admin` role is used to manage audit logging in the TiDB Cloud console, instead of database audit logging. To manage database auditing, use the `Project Owner` role at the project level.

### Project roles

At the project level, TiDB Cloud defines three roles, in which `Project Owner` can invite members and grant project roles to members.

> **Note:**
>
> - `Organization Owner` has all the permissions of <code>Project Owner</code> for all projects so `Organization Owner` can invite project members and grant project roles to members too.
> - Each project role has all the permissions of <code>Organization Member</code> by default.
> - If a user in your organization does not belong to any projects, the user does not have any project permissions.

| Permission  | `Project Owner` | `Project Data Access Read-Write` | `Project Data Access Read-Only` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Manage project settings | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Invite users to or remove users from a project, and edit project roles of users. | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manage [database audit logging](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-auditing.md) of the project. | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manage [spending limit](/tidb-cloud/manage-serverless-spend-limit.md) for all TiDB Serverless clusters in the project. | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manage cluster operations in the project, such as cluster creation, modification, and deletion. | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manage branches for TiDB Serverless clusters in the project, such as branch creation, connection, and deletion. | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manage [recovery groups](/tidb-cloud/recovery-group-overview.md) for TiDB Dedicated clusters in the project, such as recovery group creation and deletion. | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manage cluster data such as data import, data backup and restore, and data migration. | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Manage [Data Service](/tidb-cloud/data-service-overview.md) for data read-only operations such as using or creating endpoints to read data. | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Manage [Data Service](/tidb-cloud/data-service-overview.md) for data read and write operations. | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| View cluster data using [Chat2Query](/tidb-cloud/explore-data-with-chat2query.md). | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Modify and delete cluster data using [Chat2Query](/tidb-cloud/explore-data-with-chat2query.md). | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| View clusters in the project, view cluster backup records, and manage [changefeeds](/tidb-cloud/changefeed-overview.md). | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
