# TiDB Cloud Built-in Alerting

TiDB Cloud provides you with an easy way to view alerts, edit alert rules, and subscribe to alert notification emails.

This document describes how to do these operations and provides the TiDB Cloud built-in alert conditions for your reference.

> **Note:**
>
> Currently, the alert feature is only available for [TiDB Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-dedicated) clusters.

## View alerts

In TiDB Cloud, you can view both active and closed alerts on the Alerts page.

1. In the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com/), navigate to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page of your project.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > If you have multiple projects, you can click <MDSvgIcon name="icon-left-projects" /> in the lower-left corner and switch to another project.

2. Click the name of the target cluster. The cluster overview page is displayed.
3. Click **Alerts** in the left navigation pane.
4. The **Alerts** page displays the active alerts by default. You can view the information of each active alert such as the alert name, trigger time, and duration.
5. If you also want to view the closed alerts, just click the **Status** drop-down list and select **Closed** or **All**.

## Edit alert rules

In TiDB Cloud, you can edit the alert rules by disabling or enabling the alerts or updating the alert threshold.

1. On the **Alerts** page, click **Edit Rules**.
2. Disable or enable alert rules as needed.
3. Click **Edit** to update the threshold of an alert rule.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > Currently, TiDB Cloud provides limited capabilities for alert rule editing. Some alert rules do not support editing. If you would like to configure different trigger conditions or frequency, or have alerts automatically trigger actions in downstream services like [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/docs/guides/datadog-integration-guide/), consider using a [third-party monitoring and alerting integration](/tidb-cloud/third-party-monitoring-integrations.md).

## Subscribe to alert notification emails

To get alert notification emails of clusters in your project, take the following steps:

1. On the **Alerts** page , click **Subscribe Alerts**.
2. Enter your email address, and then click **Subscribe**.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > The alert subscription is for all alerts in the current project. If you have multiple clusters in the project, you just need to subscribe once.

Alternatively, you can also add the subscription from the **Alert Subscription** page as follows:

1. Log in to the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com).
2. Click <MDSvgIcon name="icon-left-projects" /> in the lower-left corner, switch to the target project if you have multiple projects, and then click **Project Settings**.
3. On the **Project Settings** page of your project, click **Alert Subscription** in the left navigation pane.
4. Click **Add Subscriber**, enter your email address in the displayed dialog, and then click **Add**.

If an alert condition remains unchanged, the alert sends email notifications every 3 hours.

## Unsubscribe from alert notification emails

If you no longer want to receive alert notification emails of clusters in your project, take the following steps:

1. Log in to the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com).
2. Click <MDSvgIcon name="icon-left-projects" /> in the lower-left corner, switch to the target project if you have multiple projects, and then click **Project Settings**.
3. On the **Project Settings** page of your project, click **Alert Subscription** in the left navigation pane.
4. Locate your email address and click **Unsubscribe**.
5. Click **Delete** to confirm the unsubscription.

## TiDB Cloud built-in alert conditions

The following table provides the TiDB Cloud built-in alert conditions and the corresponding recommended actions.

> **Note:**
>
> - While these alert conditions do not necessarily mean there is a problem, they are often early warning indicators of emerging issues. Therefore, taking the recommended action is advised.
> - You can edit the thresholds of the alerts on the TiDB Cloud console. 
> - Some alert rules are disabled by default. You can enable them as needed.

| The changefeed latency exceeds 600 seconds. | Check the changefeed status on the **Changefeed** page and **Changefeed Detail** page of the TiDB Cloud console, where you can find some error messages to help diagnose this issue. <br/> Possible reasons that can trigger this alert include:<ul><li>The overall traffic in the upstream has increased, causing the existing changefeed specification to be insufficient to handle it. If the traffic increase is temporary, the changefeed latency will automatically recover after the traffic returns to normal. If the traffic increase is continuous, you need to scale up the changefeed.</li><li>The downstream or network is abnormal. In this case, resolve this abnormality first.</li><li>Tables lack indexes if the downstream is RDS, which might cause low write performance and high latency. In this case, you need to add the necessary indexes to the upstream or downstream.</li></ul>If the problem cannot be fixed from your side, you can contact [TiDB Cloud Support](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-support.md) for further assistance. |
