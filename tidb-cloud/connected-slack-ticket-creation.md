# Create Tickets and Subscribe to Ticket Updates in Slack

For customers subscribed to the **Enterprise** [support plan](/tidb-cloud/connected-care-detail.md), TiDB Cloud provides a ticket bot called **PingCAP Support Bot** in [Slack](https://slack.com/), to support quick ticket creation.

## Create a support ticket

In the Slack support channel, you only need to mention **PingCAP Support Bot** and describe the problem in a message. Then, the ticket bot will respond with a thread containing a **Raise Request** button.

## Subscribe to ticket updates

The **Enterprise** support plan supports subscriptions to ticket updates in Slack. When a support engineer responds to a ticket, a ticket update message will appear in the Slack channel. The message includes information such as the ticket title, ticket link, and last comment content.
