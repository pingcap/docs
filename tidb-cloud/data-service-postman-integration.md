# Run Data App in Postman

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is an API platform for building and using APIs, which simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIsâ€”faster.

In TiDB Cloud [Data Service](https://tidbcloud.com/console/data-service), you can easily connect your Data App to Postman and leverage Postman's extensive tools to enhance your API development experience.

This document describes how to connect your Data App to Postman and how to run your Data App in Postman.

## Before you begin

Before connecting a Data App to Postman, make sure that you have the following:

- A [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) account.
- A [Postman client](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) (Optional. You can use the Postman webpage version without downloading the client.)
- A Data App with at least one endpoint.
- An [API key](/tidb-cloud/data-service-api-key.md#create-an-api-key) for the Data App.

## Step 1. Connect your Data App to Postman

To connect your Data App to Postman, take the following steps:

1. In the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com/), navigate to the [**Data Service**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/data-service) page of your project.
2. In the left pane, click the name of your target Data App to view its details.
3. In the upper-right corner of the page, click **Run in Postman**. A dialog for connection instructions is displayed.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > For `Chat2Query` Data App, **Run in Postman** is unavailable.

4. Follow the steps provided in the dialog for the Postman connection:

    1. Depending the version Postman version you want to use, click **Run in Postman for Web** or **Run in Postman for Client** to open your Postman workspaces, and then click your target workspace in Postman.

        - If you have not logged into Postman, follow the on-screen instructions log into Postman first.
        - If you clicked **Run in Postman for Client**, follow the on-screen instructions to open the Postman client.

    2. On the page of your target workspace in Postman, click **Import** in the left navigation menu.
    3. Copy the Data App URL in the TiDB Cloud dialog, and then past the URL to Postman for the import.

5. After you paste the URL, Postman imports the Data App automatically as a collection. The name of the connection is in the `TiDB Data Service - <Your App Name>` format.

    The deployed endpoints are grouped in the **Deployed** folder and the undeployed endpoints are grouped in the **Draft** folder.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > Postman only imports endpoints that are ready for use. If an endpoint does not have target cluster, database, table, path, or SQL statements, the endpoint is skipped by the import.

## Step 2. Configure your Data App API key in Postman

Before running an imported Data App in Postman, you need to configure the Data App API key in Postman as follows:

1. In the left navigation pane of Postman, click `TiDB Data Service - <Your App Name>` to open a tab for it on the right side.
2. Under the `TiDB Data Service - <Your App Name>` tab, click the **Variables** tab.
3. In the table for variables, paste your public key and private key for your Data App to the **Current value** column.
4. In the upper-right corner of the `TiDB Data Service - <Your App Name>` tab, click **Save**.

## Step 3. Run Data App in Postman

1. In the left navigation pane of Postman, expand the Deployed or Draft folder, and then click your endpoint name to open a tab for it on the right side.
2. Under the `<Your Endpoint Name>` tab, you can call your endpoint as follows:

    - For an endpoint without parameters, you can click **Send** to call it directly.
    - For en endpoints with parameters, you need to fill in the values of the parameters first, and then click **Send**.

        - For a GET or DELETE request, fill in values of the parameters in the **Query Params** table.
        - For a POST or PUT request, click the **Body** tab, and then fill in values of the parameters as an JSON object. If **Batch Operation** is enabled for the endpoint in TiDB Cloud Data Service, and then fill in values of the parameters as an array of JSON objects.

3. Check the response in the lower pane.

4. If you want to call the endpoint again with different parameter values, you can edit the parameter values accordingly, and then click **Send** again.

## Deal with new changes in Data App

After a Data App is imported to Postman, TiDB Cloud Data Service will not synchronize the following changes to the Data App to Postman automatically.

- The creation of new endpoints
- The renaming or deletion of existing endpoints
- The parameter modification of existing endpoints

If you want to have these changes in Postman, you need to import the latest Data App to Postman again. Because a connection name is unique in a Postman workspace, you can either use the latest Data App to replace the previously imported one or import the latest Data App as a new connection.

After the import, you need to configure the API key for the newly imported App in Postman again.
