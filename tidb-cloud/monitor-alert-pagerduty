# Subscribe via PagerDuty

TiDB Cloud provides you with an easy way to subscribe to alert notifications via PagerDuty, [Slack](/tidb-cloud/monitor-alert-slack.md), [email](/tidb-cloud/monitor-alert-email.md), [Zoom](/tidb-cloud/monitor-alert-zoom.md), and [Flashduty](/tidb-cloud/monitor-alert-flashduty.md). This document describes how to subscribe to alert notifications via PagerDuty.

> **Note:**
>
> Currently, alert subscription is only available for [TiDB Cloud Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-cloud-dedicated) clusters.

## Prerequisites

- Subscribing to alerts via PagerDuty is only available for organizations that subscribe to the **Enterprise** or **Premium** [support plan](/tidb-cloud/connected-care-overview.md).

- To subscribe to alert notifications, you must have the `Organization Owner` access to your organization or `Project Owner` access to the target project in TiDB Cloud.

## Subscribe to alert notifications

To get alert notifications of clusters in your project, take the following steps:

### Step 1. Generate a PagerDuty integration key

1. Refer to the official [PagerDuty documentation](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/events-api-v2-overview#getting-started) to generate an integration key of 'Events API v2' type.
2. Copy the integration key generated in step 1.

### Step 2. Subscribe from TiDB Cloud

> **Tip:**
>
> The alert subscription is for all alerts in the current project. If you have multiple clusters in the project, you just need to subscribe once.

1. In the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com), switch to your target project using the combo box in the upper-left corner.
2. In the left navigation pane, click **Project Settings** > **Alert Subscription**.
3. On the **Alert Subscription** page, click **Add Subscriber** in the upper-right corner.
4. From the **Subscriber Type** drop-down list, select **PagerDuty**.
5. Enter a name in the **Name** field and your integration key in the **Integration Key** field.
6. Click **Test Connection**.

    - If the test succeeds, the **Save** button is displayed.
    - If the test fails, an error message is displayed. Follow the message to troubleshoot the issue and retry the connection.

7. Click **Save** to complete the subscription.

Alternatively, you can also click **Subscribe** in the upper-right corner of the **Alert** page of the cluster. You will be directed to the **Alert Subscriber** page.

If an alert condition remains unchanged, the alert sends notifications every three hours.

## Unsubscribe from alert notifications

If you no longer want to receive alert notifications for clusters in your project, follow these steps:

1. In the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com), switch to your target project using the combo box in the upper-left corner.
2. In the left navigation pane, click **Project Settings** > **Alert Subscription**.
3. On the **Alert Subscription** page, find the subscriber that you want to delete, and then click **...** > **Unsubscribe**.
4. Click **Unsubscribe** to confirm the unsubscription.
