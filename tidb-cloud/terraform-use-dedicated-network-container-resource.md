# Use Dedicated Network Container Resource

You can learn how to manage a TiDB Cloud dedicated network container with the `tidbcloud_dedicated_network_container` resource in this document.

The features of the `tidbcloud_dedicated_network_container` resource include the following:

- Create TiDB Cloud Dedicated network container.
- Import TiDB Cloud Dedicated network container.

> **Note:**
>
> TiDB Cloud Dedicated network container can not be modified or deleted. Make sure the configuration of the `tidbcloud_network_container` resource is correct before you apply it.

## Prerequisites

- [Get TiDB Cloud Terraform Provider](/tidb-cloud/terraform-get-tidbcloud-provider.md) at least v0.4.0.


## Create a dedicated network container using the dedicated network container resource

You can create a dedicated network container using the `tidbcloud_dedicated_network_container` resource.

The following example shows how to create a TiDB Cloud dedicated network container.

1. Create a directory for the dedicated network container and enter it.

2. Create a `network_container.tf` file:
    ```
    terraform {
      required_providers {
        tidbcloud = {
          source = "tidbcloud/tidbcloud"
        }
      }
    }

    provider "tidbcloud" {
      public_key = "your_public_key"
      private_key = "your_private_key"
    }

    resource "tidbcloud_dedicated_network_container" "example" {
      project_id = "1372813089454000000"
      region_id = "aws-ap-northeast-2"
      cidr_notion = "172.16.16.0/21"
    }
    ```

    Use the `resource` block to define the resource of TiDB Cloud, including the resource type, resource name, and resource details.

    - To use the dedicated network container resource, set the resource type as `tidbcloud_dedicated_network_container`.
    - For the resource name, you can define it according to your need. For example, `example`.
    - If you don't know how to get the values of the required arguments, see [Set a CIDR for a Region](/tidb-cloud/set-up-vpc-peering-connections.md#prerequisite-set-a-cidr-for-a-region).

3. Run the `terraform apply` command. It is not recommended to use `terraform apply --auto-approve` when you apply a resource.

    ```shell
    $ terraform apply

    Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
      + create

    Terraform will perform the following actions:

        # tidbcloud_dedicated_network_container.example will be created
        + resource "tidbcloud_dedicated_network_container" "example" {
            + cidr_notion          = "172.16.16.0/21"
            + cloud_provider       = (known after apply)
            + labels               = (known after apply)
            + network_container_id = (known after apply)
            + project_id           = "1372813089454543324"
            + region_display_name  = (known after apply)
            + region_id            = "aws-ap-northeast-2"
            + state                = (known after apply)
            + vpc_id               = (known after apply)
        }

    Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

    Do you want to perform these actions?
        Terraform will perform the actions described above.
        Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

        Enter a value:
    ```

   As in the above result, Terraform generates an execution plan for you, which describes the actions Terraform will take:

   - You can check the difference between the configurations and the states.
   - You can also see the results of this `apply`. It will add a new resource, and no resource will be changed or destroyed.
   - The `known after apply` shows that you will get the value after `apply`.

4. If everything in your plan looks fine, type `yes` to continue:

    ```shell
    Do you want to perform these actions?
      Terraform will perform the actions described above.
      Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

      Enter a value: yes

    tidbcloud_dedicated_network_container.example: Creating...
    tidbcloud_dedicated_network_container.example: Creation complete after 4s
    ```

    The status of the resource will keep being `INACTIVE` until the you create a dedicated cluster in the region of the dedicated network container. Then the status will change to `ACTIVE`.

5. Use the `terraform show` or `terraform state show tidbcloud_dedicated_network_container.${resource-name}` command to inspect the state of your resource. The former will show the states of all resources and data sources.

    ```shell
    $ terraform state show tidbcloud_dedicated_network_container.example          
    # tidbcloud_dedicated_network_container.example:
    resource "tidbcloud_dedicated_network_container" "example" {
        cidr_notion          = "172.16.16.0/21"
        cloud_provider       = "aws"
        labels               = {
            "tidb.cloud/project" = "1372813089454000000"
        }
        network_container_id = "1934235512696000000"
        project_id           = "1372813089454000000"
        region_display_name  = "Seoul (ap-northeast-2)"
        region_id            = "aws-ap-northeast-2"
        state                = "INACTIVE"
        vpc_id               = null
    }
    ```

## Import a Dedicated network container

For a TiDB Cloud dedicated network container that is not managed by Terraform, you can use Terraform to manage it just by importing it.

For example, you can import a network container that is not created by Terraform.

1. Add an import block for the new dedicated network container resource

- Add the following import block to your `.tf` file, replace `example` with a desired resource name, and replace `${id}` with the format of `cluster_id,network_container_id`:

    ```
    import {
      to = tidbcloud_dedicated_network_container.example
      id = "10423692645683000000,your_network_container_id"
    }
    ```
2. Generate the new configuration file

Generate the new configuration file for the new dedicated vpc peering resource according to the import block:

  ```shell
  terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated.tf
  ```

Do not specify an existing `.tf` file name in the preceding command. Otherwise, Terraform will return an error.

Then the `generated.tf` file is created in the current directory, which contains the configuration of the imported resource.

3. Review and apply the generated configuration

Review the generated configuration file to ensure it meets your needs. Optionally, you can move the contents of this file to your preferred location.

Then, run `terraform apply` to import your infrastructure. After applying, the example output is as follows: 

  ```shell
  tidbcloud_dedicated_network_container.example: Importing... [id=10423692645683000000,example]
  tidbcloud_dedicated_network_container.example: Import complete [id=10423692645683000000,example]

  Apply complete! Resources: 1 imported, 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
  ```

Now you can manage the imported dedicated network container with Terraform.
