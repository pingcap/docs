# Subscribe via Slack

TiDB Cloud provides you with an easy way to subscribe to alert notifications via [Slack](https://slack.com/), [email](/tidb-cloud/monitor-alert-email.md), and [Zoom](/tidb-cloud/monitor-alert-zoom.md). This document describes how to subscribe to alert notifications via Slack.

The following screenshot shows two example alerts.

> **Note:**
>
> Currently, alert subscription is only available for [TiDB Cloud Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-cloud-dedicated) clusters.

## Prerequisites

- The subscribing via Slack feature is only available for organizations that subscribe to the **Enterprise** or **Premium** support plan.

- To subscribe to alert notifications of TiDB Cloud, you must have the `Organization Owner` access to your organization or `Project Owner` access to the target project in TiDB Cloud.

## Subscribe to alert notifications

### Step 1. Generate a Slack webhook URL

1. [Create a Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps/new), if you do not have one already. Click **Create New App**, and choose **From scratch**. Enter a name, choose a workspace to associate your app with, and then click **Create App**.
2. Go to the settings page for your app. You can load its settings via your [app's management dashboard](https://api.slack.com/apps).
3. Click the **Incoming Webhooks** tab, and then toggle **Activate Incoming Webhooks** to **ON**.
4. Click **Add New Webhook to Workspace**.
5. Select a channel that you want to receive alert notifications in, and then select **Authorize**. If you need to add the incoming webhook to a private channel, you must first be in that channel.

You can see a new entry under the **Webhook URLs for Your Workspace** section in the following format: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`.

### Step 2. Subscribe from TiDB Cloud

> **Tip:**
>
> The alert subscription is for all alerts in the current project. If you have multiple clusters in the project, you just need to subscribe once.

1. In the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com), switch to your target project using the combo box in the upper-left corner.
2. In the left navigation pane, click **Project Settings** > **Alert Subscription**.
3. On the **Alert Subscription** page, click **Add Subscriber** in the upper-right corner.
4. Select **Slack** from the **Subscriber Type** drop-down list.
5. Enter a name in the **Name** field and your Slack webhook URL in the **URL** field.
6. Click **Test Connection**.

    - If the test succeeds, the **Save** button is displayed.
    - If the test fails, an error message is displayed. Follow the message to troubleshoot the issue and retry the connection.

7. Click **Save** to complete the subscription.

Alternatively, you can also click **Subscribe** in the upper-right corner of the **Alert** page of the cluster. You will be directed to the **Alert Subscriber** page.

If an alert condition remains unchanged, the alert sends notifications every three hours.

## Unsubscribe from alert notifications

If you no longer want to receive alert notifications of clusters in your project, take the following steps:

1. In the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com), switch to your target project using the combo box in the upper-left corner.
2. In the left navigation pane, click **Project Settings** > **Alert Subscription**.
3. On the **Alert Subscription** page, locate the row of your target subscriber to be deleted, and then click **...** > **Unsubscribe**.
4. Click **Unsubscribe** to confirm the unsubscription.
