# Limitations and Quotas in TiDB Cloud

TiDB Cloud limits how many of each kind of component you can create, and the common usage limitations of TiDB. In addition, there are some organization-level quotas to limit the amount of resources created by users to prevent from creating more resources than you actually need. These tables outline limits and quotas.

> **Note:**
>
> If any of these limits or quotas present a problem for your organization, please contact [TiDB Cloud support](tidb-cloud-support.md).

## Cluster Limits

| Component | Limit |
|:-|:-|
| Number of data replicas | 3 |
| Number of Availability Zones for a cross-zone deployment | 3 |
