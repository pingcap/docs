# Explore Your Data with AI-Powered Chat2Query (beta)

TiDB Cloud is powered by AI. You can use Chat2Query (beta), an AI-powered SQL editor in the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com/), to maximize your data value.

In Chat2Query, you can either simply type `--` followed by your instructions to let AI generate SQL queries automatically or write SQL queries manually, and then run SQL queries against databases without a terminal. You can find the query results in tables intuitively and check the query logs easily.

## Limitations

- SQL queries generated by the AI might not be 100% accurate, and you might need to refine them.
- Chat2Query is only supported for TiDB clusters that are v6.5.0 or later and hosted on AWS.
- Chat2Query and the [Chat2Query API](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/use-chat2query-api) are available by default for [TiDB Serverless](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-serverless) clusters. To use Chat2Query or the Chat2Query API on [TiDB Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-dedicated) clusters, contact [TiDB Cloud support](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-support.md).

## Use cases

The recommended use cases of Chat2Query are as follows:

- Use the AI capacity of Chat2Query to help you generate complex SQL queries instantly.
- Test out the MySQL compatibility of TiDB quickly.
- Explore TiDB SQL features easily.

## Access Chat2Query

1. Go to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page of your project.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > If you have multiple projects, you can click <MDSvgIcon name="icon-left-projects" /> in the lower-left corner and switch to another project.

2. Click your cluster name, and then click **Chat2Query** in the left navigation pane.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > In the following cases, the **Chat2Query** entry is displayed in gray and not clickable.
    >
    > - Your TiDB Dedicated cluster is earlier than v6.5.0. To use Chat2Query, you need to contract [TiDB Cloud support](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-support.md) to upgrade your clusters.
    > - Your TiDB Dedicated cluster is just created and the running environment for Chat2Query is still in preparation. In this case, wait for a few minutes and Chat2Query will be available.
    > - Your TiDB Dedicated cluster is [paused](/tidb-cloud/pause-or-resume-tidb-cluster.md).

## Enable or disable AI to generate SQL queries

PingCAP takes the privacy and security of users' data as a top priority. The AI capacity of Chat2Query only needs to access database schemas to generate SQL queries, not your data itself. For more information, see [Chat2Query Privacy FAQ](https://www.pingcap.com/privacy-policy/privacy-chat2query).

When you access Chat2Query for the first time, you will be prompted with a dialog about whether to allow PingCAP and OpenAI to use your code snippets to research and improve the services.

- To enable the AI to generate SQL queries, select the checkbox and click **Save and Get Started**.
- To disable the AI to generate SQL queries, close this dialog directly.

After the first-time access, you can still change the AI setting as follows:

- To enable AI, click **Enable AI power for data exploration** in the upper-right corner of Chat2Query.
- To disable AI, click <MDSvgIcon name="icon-top-account-settings" /> in the lower-left corner of the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com/), click **Account Settings**, click the **Privacy** tab, and then disable the **AI-powered Data Exploration** option.

## Write and run SQL queries

In Chat2Query, you can write and run SQL queries using your own dataset.

1. Write SQL queries.

    - If AI is enabled, simply type `--` followed by your instructions to let AI generate SQL queries automatically or write SQL queries manually.

        For a SQL query generated by AI, you can accept it by pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> and then further edit it if needed, or reject it by pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd>.

    - If AI is disabled, write SQL queries manually.

2. Run SQL queries.

## Manage SQL files

In Chat2Query, you can save your SQL queries in different SQL files and manage SQL files as follows:

- To add a SQL file, click **+** on the **SQL Files** tab.
- To rename a SQL file, move your cursor on the filename, click **...** next to the filename, and then select **Rename**.
- To delete a SQL file, move your cursor on the filename, click **...** next to the filename, and then select **Delete**. Note that when there is only one SQL file on the **SQL Files** tab, you cannot delete it.

## Access Chat2Query via API

In addition to accessing Chat2Query via UI, you can also access Chat2Query via API. To do so, you need to create a Chat2Query Data App first.

In Chat2Query, you can access or create a Chat2Query Data App as follows:

1. Click **...** in the upper-right corner, and then click **Access Chat2Query via API**.
2. In the displayed dialog, do one of the following:

    - To create a new Chat2Query Data App, click **New Chat2Query Data App**.
    - To access an existing Chat2Query Data App, click the name of target Data App.

For more information, see [Get started with Chat2Query API](/tidb-cloud/use-chat2query-api.md).

## Generate an endpoint from a SQL file

For TiDB clusters, TiDB Cloud provides a [Data Service (beta)](/tidb-cloud/data-service-overview.md) feature that enables you to access TiDB Cloud data via an HTTPS request using a custom API endpoint. In Chat2Query, you can generate an endpoint of Data Service (beta) from a SQL file by taking the following steps:

1. Move your cursor on the filename, click **...** next to the filename, and then select **Generate endpoint**.
2. In the **Generate endpoint** dialog box, select the Data App you want to generate the endpoint for and enter the endpoint name.
3. Click **Generate**. The endpoint is generated and its details page is displayed.

For more information, see [Manage an endpoint](/tidb-cloud/data-service-manage-endpoint.md).

## Manage Chat2Query settings

In Chat2Query, you can change the following settings:

- The maximum number of rows in query results
- Whether to show system database schemas on the **Schemas** tab

To change the settings, take the following steps:

1. In the upper-right corner of Chat2Query, click **...** and select **Settings**.
2. Change the settings according to your need.
3. Click **Save**.
