# TiDB Cloud Partner Web Console

TiDB Cloud Partner Web Console is designed for partners focused on SaaS solutions, with the goal of building and nurturing a strong partnership between PingCAP and our partners to better serve our customers.

There are two types of TiDB Cloud partners:

- Reseller: resells TiDB Cloud through AWS Marketplace Channel Partner Private Offer (CPPO)
- Managed Service Provider (MSP): resells TiDB Cloud and provides value-added services

## Reseller through AWS Channel Partner Private Offer (CPPO)

The reseller through [AWS CPPO](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/features/cpprivateoffers) allows customers to purchase TiDB Cloud through the AWS Marketplace directly from a reseller. This enables customers to benefit from the partner's business knowledge, localized support, and expertise, while still enjoying the fast and seamless purchasing experience they expect from AWS Marketplace.
