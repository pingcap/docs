# Back Up and Restore {{{ .starter }}} or Essential Data

This document describes how to back up and restore your data on {{{ .starter }}} or {{{ .essential }}} clusters.

> **Tip:**
>
> To learn how to back up and restore data on TiDB Cloud Dedicated clusters, see [Back Up and Restore TiDB Cloud Dedicated Data](/tidb-cloud/backup-and-restore.md).

## View the Backup page

1. On the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/project/clusters) page, click the name of your target cluster to go to its overview page.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > You can use the combo box in the upper-left corner to switch between organizations, projects, and clusters.

2. In the left navigation pane, click **Data** > **Backup**.

## Automatic backups

TiDB Cloud automatically backs up your cluster data, allowing you to restore data from a backup snapshot to minimize data loss in the event of a disaster.

### Learn about the backup setting

Automatic backup settings vary between {{{ .starter }}} clusters and {{{ .essential }}} clusters, as shown in the following table:

| Backup setting   | {{{ .starter }}} (free) | {{{ .starter }}} (with spending limit > 0) | {{{ .essential }}} |
|------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Backup Cycle     | Daily                      | Daily                      | Daily                      |
| Backup Retention | 1 day                      | Up to 30 days              | Up to 30 days              |
| Backup Time      | Fixed time                 | Configurable               | Configurable               |

- **Backup Cycle** is the frequency at which backups are taken.

- **Backup Retention** is the duration for which backups are retained. Expired backups cannot be restored.

    - For a free {{{ .starter }}} cluster, the backup retention is 1 day.
    - For a {{{ .starter }}} (with spending limit > 0) or {{{ .essential }}} cluster, you can configure the backup retention to any value between 1 and 30 days. The default retention is 14 days.

- **Backup Time** is the time when the backup starts to be scheduled. Note that the final backup time might fall behind the configured backup time.

    - For a free {{{ .starter }}} cluster, the backup time is a randomly fixed time.
    - For a {{{ .starter }}} (with spending limit > 0) or {{{ .essential }}} cluster, you can configure the backup time to every half an hour. The default value is a randomly fixed time.

### Configure the backup setting

To set the backup time for a {{{ .essential }}} cluster, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [**Backup**](#view-the-backup-page) page of your cluster.

2. Click **Backup Setting**. This will open the **Backup Setting** window, where you can configure the automatic backup settings according to your requirements.

3. In **Backup Time**, schedule a start time for the daily cluster backup.

4. Click **Confirm**.

## Restore

TiDB Cloud clusters offer restore functionality to help recover data in case of accidental loss or corruption.

### Restore mode

TiDB Cloud supports snapshot restore and point-in-time restore for your cluster.

- **Snapshot Restore**: restores your cluster from a specific backup snapshot.

- **Point-in-Time Restore (beta)**: restores your cluster to a specific time.

    - {{{ .starter }}} clusters: not supported.
    - {{{ .essential }}} clusters: restores to any time within the backup retention, but not earlier than the cluster creation time or later than one minute before the current time.

### Restore destination

TiDB Cloud supports restoring data to a new cluster.

### Restore timeout

The restore process typically completes within a few minutes. If the restore takes longer than three hours, it is automatically canceled and the new cluster is deleted, while the source cluster remains unchanged.

If the data is corrupted after a canceled restore and cannot be recovered, contact [TiDB Cloud Support](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-support.md) for assistance.

### Perform the restore

> **Note:**
>
> User credentials and permissions from the source cluster will not be restored to the new cluster.

To restore your data to a new cluster, take the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [**Backup**](#view-the-backup-page) page of your cluster.

2. Click **Restore**.

3. In **Restore Mode**, you can choose to restore from a specific backup or any point in time.

    <SimpleTab>
    <div label="Snapshot Restore">

    To restore from a selected backup snapshot, take the following steps:

    1. Click **Snapshot Restore**.
    2. Select the backup snapshot you want to restore from.

    </div>
    <div label="Point-in-Time Restore">

    To restore to a specific point in time for a {{{ .essential }}} cluster, take the following steps:

    1. Click **Point-in-Time Restore**.
    2. Select the date and time you want to restore to.

    </div>
    </SimpleTab>

4. Enter a name for the new cluster.
5. Choose a plan for the new cluster and update the capacity as needed.

    - If you choose a {{{ .starter }}} cluster and need more resources than the [free quota](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#usage-quota), set a monthly spending limit.
    - If you choose a {{{ .essential }}} cluster, set the minimum RCU and maximum RCU, and then configure advanced settings as needed.

6. Click **Restore** to begin the restore process.

Once the restore process begins, the cluster status changes to **Restoring**. The cluster will remain unavailable until the restore is complete and the status changes to **Available**.

## Limitations

- If a TiFlash replica is enabled, it will be unavailable for a period after the restore, because the data needs to be rebuilt in TiFlash.
- Manual backups are not supported for {{{ .starter }}} and {{{ .essential }}} clusters.
- Clusters with more than 1 TiB of data do not support restoring to new clusters by default. Contact [TiDB Cloud Support](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-support.md) for assistance with larger datasets.
