## Invoices

If you are in the `Organization Owner` or `Organization Billing Admin` role of your organization, you can manage the invoice information of TiDB Cloud. Otherwise, skip this section.

After you set up the payment method, TiDB Cloud will generate an invoice once your cost reaches a quota, which is $500 by default. If you want to raise the quota or receive one invoice per month, you can [contact our sales](https://www.pingcap.com/contact-us/).

> **Note:**
>
> If you sign up for TiDB Cloud through [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace) or [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace), you can pay through your AWS account or Google Cloud account directly but cannot add payment methods or download invoices in the TiDB Cloud console.

After you contact our sales for receiving an invoice on a monthly basis, TiDB Cloud will generate the invoice for the previous month at the beginning of each month.

Invoice costs include TiDB cluster usage consumption, discounts, backup storage costs, support service cost, credit consumption, and data transmission costs in your organization.

For each monthly invoice:

- TiDB Cloud provides the invoice to you on the ninth of each month. From the first to the ninth day, you cannot view the last month's cost details, but can obtain the cluster usage information of this month via the billing console.
- The default method for paying invoices is credit card deduction. If you want to use other payment methods, please send a ticket request to let us know.
- You can view the summary and details of charges for the current month and the previous month.

>
> All billing deductions will be completed through the third-party platform Stripe.

1. Click <MDSvgIcon name="icon-top-organization" /> in the lower-left corner of the TiDB Cloud console.
