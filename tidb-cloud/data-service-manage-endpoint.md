# Manage an Endpoint

An endpoint in Data Service (beta) is a web API that you can customize to execute SQL statements. You can specify parameters for the SQL statements, such as the value used in the `WHERE` clause. When a client calls an endpoint and provides values for the parameters in a request URL, the endpoint executes the SQL statement with the provided parameters and returns the results as part of the HTTP response.

This document describes how to manage your endpoints in a Data App in the TiDB Cloud console.

## Before you begin

- Before you create an endpoint, make sure the following:

    - You have created a cluster and a Data App. For more information, see [Create a Data App](/tidb-cloud/data-service-manage-data-app.md#create-a-data-app).
    - The databases, tables, and columns that the endpoint will operate on already exist in the target cluster.

- Before you call an endpoint, make sure that you have created an API key in the Data App. For more information, see [Create an API key](/tidb-cloud/data-service-api-key.md#create-an-api-key).

## Create an endpoint

In Data Service, you can automatically generate endpoints, manually create endpoints, or add predefined system endpoints.

> **Tip:**
>
> You can also create an endpoint from a SQL file in SQL Editor. For more information, see [Generate an endpoint from a SQL file](/tidb-cloud/explore-data-with-chat2query.md#generate-an-endpoint-from-a-sql-file).

### Generate an endpoint automatically

In TiDB Cloud Data Service, you can generate one or multiple endpoints automatically in one go as follows:

1. Navigate to the [**Data Service**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/data-service) page of your project.
2. In the left pane, locate your target Data App, click **+** to the right of the App name, and then click **Autogenerate Endpoint**. The dialog for endpoint generation is displayed.
3. In the dialog, do the following:

    1. Select the target cluster, database, and table for the endpoint to be generated.

        > **Note:**
        >
        > The **Table** drop-down list includes only user-defined tables with at least one column, excluding system tables and any tables without a column definition.

    2. Select at least one HTTP operation (such as `GET (Retrieve)`, `POST (Create)`, and `PUT (Update)`) for the endpoint to be generated.

        For each operation you select, TiDB Cloud Data Service will generate a corresponding endpoint. If you select a batch operation (such as `POST (Batch Create)`), the generated endpoint lets you operate on multiple rows in a single request.

        If the table you selected contains [vector data types](/tidb-cloud/vector-search-data-types.md), you can enable the **Vector Search Operations** option and select a vector distance function to generate a vector search endpoint that automatically calculates vector distances based on your selected distance function. The supported [vector distance functions](/tidb-cloud/vector-search-functions-and-operators.md) include the following:

        - `VEC_L2_DISTANCE` (default): calculates the L2 distance (Euclidean distance) between two vectors.
        - `VEC_COSINE_DISTANCE`: calculates the cosine distance between two vectors.
        - `VEC_NEGATIVE_INNER_PRODUCT`: calculates the distance by using the negative of the inner product between two vectors.
        - `VEC_L1_DISTANCE`: calculates the L1 distance (Manhattan distance) between two vectors.
       
    3. (Optional) Configure a timeout and tag for the operations. All the generated endpoints will automatically inherit the configured properties, which can be modified later as needed.
    4. (Optional) The **Auto-Deploy Endpoint** option (disabled by default) controls whether to enable the direct deployment of the generated endpoints. When it is enabled, the draft review process is skipped, and the generated endpoints are deployed immediately without further manual review or approval.

4. Click **Generate**.

    The generated endpoint is displayed at the top of the endpoint list.

5. Check the generated endpoint name, SQL statements, properties, and parameters of the new endpoint.

    - Endpoint name: the generated endpoint name is in the `/<name of the selected table>` format, and the request method (such as `GET`, `POST`, and `PUT`) is displayed before the endpoint name. For example, if the selected table name is `sample_table` and the selected operation is `POST (Create)`, the generated endpoint is displayed as `POST /sample_table`.

        - If a batch operation is selected, TiDB Cloud Data Service appends `/bulk` to the name of the generated endpoint. For example, if the selected table name is `/sample_table` and the selected operation is `POST (Batch Create)`, the generated endpoint is displayed as `POST /sample_table/bulk`.
        - If `POST (Vector Similarity Search)` is selected, TiDB Cloud Data Service appends `/vector_search` to the name of the generated endpoint. For example, if the selected table name is `/sample_table` and the selected operation is `POST (Vector Similarity Search)`, the generated endpoint is displayed as `POST /sample_table/vector_search`.
        - If there has been already an endpoint with the same request method and endpoint name, TiDB Cloud Data Service appends `_dump_<random letters>` to the name of the generated endpoint. For example, `/sample_table_dump_EUKRfl`.

    - SQL statements: TiDB Cloud Data Service automatically writes SQL statements for the generated endpoints according to the table column specifications and the selected endpoint operations. You can click the endpoint name to view its SQL statements in the middle section of the page.
    - Endpoint properties: TiDB Cloud Data Service automatically configures the endpoint path, request method, timeout, and tag according to your selection. You can find the properties in the right pane of the page.
    - Endpoint parameters: TiDB Cloud Data Service automatically configures parameters for the generated endpoints. You can find the parameters in the right pane of the page.

6. If you want to modify the details of the generated endpoint, such as its name, SQL statements, properties, or parameters, refer to the instructions provided in [Develop an endpoint](#deploy-an-endpoint).

### Create an endpoint manually

To create an endpoint manually, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [**Data Service**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/data-service) page of your project.
2. In the left pane, locate your target Data App, click **+** to the right of the App name, and then click **Create Endpoint**.
3. Update the default name if necessary. The newly created endpoint is added to the top of the endpoint list.
4. Configure the new endpoint according to the instructions in [Develop an endpoint](#develop-an-endpoint).

### Add a predefined system endpoint

Data Service provides an endpoint library with predefined system endpoints that you can directly add to your Data App, reducing the effort in your endpoint development. Currently, the library only includes the `/system/query` endpoint, which enables you to execute any SQL statement by simply passing the statement in the predefined `sql` parameter.

To add a predefined system endpoint to your Data App, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [**Data Service**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/data-service) page of your project.

2. In the left pane, locate your target Data App, click **+** to the right of the App name, and then click **Manage Endpoint Library**.

    A dialog for endpoint library management is displayed. Currently, only **Execute Query** (that is, the `/system/query` endpoint) is provided in the dialog.

3. To add the `/system/query` endpoint to your Data App, toggle the **Execute Query** switch to **Added**.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > To remove an added predefined endpoint from your Data App, toggle the **Execute Query** switch to **Removed**.

4. Click **Save**.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > - After you click **Save**, the added or removed endpoint is deployed to production immediately, which makes the added endpoint accessible and the removed endpoint inaccessible immediately.
    > - If a non-predefined endpoint with the same path and method already exists in the current App, the creation of the system endpoint will fail.

    The added system-provided endpoint is displayed at the top of the endpoint list.

5. Check the endpoint name, SQL statements, properties, and parameters of the new endpoint.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > The `/system/query` endpoint is powerful and versatile but can be potentially destructive. Use it with discretion and ensure the queries are secure and well-considered to prevent unintended consequences.

    - Endpoint name: the endpoint name and path is `/system/query`, and the request method `POST`.
    - SQL statements: the `/system/query` endpoint does not come with any SQL statement. You can find the SQL editor in the middle section of the page and write your desired SQL statements in the SQL editor. Note that the SQL statements written in the SQL editor for the `/system/query` endpoint will be saved in the SQL editor so you can further develop and test them next time but they will not be saved in the endpoint configuration.
    - Endpoint properties: in the right pane of the page, you can find the endpoint properties on the **Properties** tab. Unlike other custom endpoints, only the `timeout` and `max rows` properties can be customized for system endpoints.
    - Endpoint parameters: in the right pane of the page, you can find the endpoint parameters on the **Params** tab. The parameters of the `/system/query` endpoint are configured automatically and cannot be modified.

## Develop an endpoint

For each endpoint, you can write SQL statements to execute on a TiDB cluster, define parameters for the SQL statements, or manage the name and version.

> **Note:**
>
> If you have connected your Data App to GitHub with **Auto Sync & Deployment** enabled, you can also update the endpoint configurations using GitHub. Any changes you made in GitHub will be deployed in TiDB Cloud Data Service automatically. For more information, see [Deploy automatically with GitHub](/tidb-cloud/data-service-manage-github-connection.md).

### Configure properties

On the right pane of the endpoint details page, you can click the **Properties** tab to view and configure properties of the endpoint.

#### Basic properties

- **Path**: the path that users use to access the endpoint.

    - The length of the path must be less than 64 characters.
    - The combination of the request method and the path must be unique within a Data App.
    - Only letters, numbers, underscores (`_`), slashes (`/`), and parameters enclosed in curly braces (such as `{var}`) are allowed in a path. Each path must start with a slash (`/`) and end with a letter, number, or underscore (`_`). For example, `/my_endpoint/get_id`.
    - For parameters enclosed in `{ }`, only letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`) are allowed. Each parameter enclosed in `{ }` must start with a letter or underscore (`_`).

    > **Note:**
    >
    > - In a path, each parameter must be at a separate level and does not support prefixes or suffixes.
    >
    >    Valid path: ```/var/{var}``` and  ```/{var}```
    >
    >    Invalid path: ```/var{var}``` and ```/{var}var```
    >
    > - Paths with the same method and prefix might conflict, as in the following example:
    >
    >    ```GET /var/{var1}```
    >
    >    ```GET /var/{var2}```
    >
    >   These two paths will conflict with each other because `GET /var/123` matches both.
    >
    > - Paths with parameters have lower priority than paths without parameters. For example:
    >
    >    ```GET /var/{var1}```
    >
    >    ```GET /var/123```
    >
    >   These two paths will not conflict because `GET /var/123` takes precedence.
    >
    > - Path parameters can be used directly in SQL. For more information, see [Configure parameters](#configure-parameters).

- **Endpoint URL**: (read-only) the default URL is automatically generated based on the region where the corresponding cluster is located, the service URL of the Data App, and the path of the endpoint. For example, if the path of the endpoint is `/my_endpoint/get_id`, the endpoint URL is `https://<region>.data.tidbcloud.com/api/v1beta/app/<App ID>/endpoint/my_endpoint/get_id`. To configure a custom domain for the Data App, see [Custom Domain in Data Service](/tidb-cloud/data-service-custom-domain.md).

- **Request Method**: the HTTP method of the endpoint. The following methods are supported:

    - `GET`: use this method to query or retrieve data, such as a `SELECT` statement.
    - `POST`: use this method to insert or create data, such as an `INSERT` statement.
    - `PUT`: use this method to update or modify data, such as an `UPDATE` statement.
    - `DELETE`: use this method to delete data, such as a `DELETE` statement.

- **Description** (Optional): the description of the endpoint.

#### Advanced properties

- **Timeout(ms)**: the timeout for the endpoint, in milliseconds.
- **Max Rows**: the maximum number of rows that the endpoint can operate or return.
- **Tag**: the tag used for identifying a group of endpoints.
- **Pagination**: this property is available only when the request method is `GET` and the last SQL statement of the endpoint is a `SELECT` operation. When **Pagination** is enabled, you can paginate the results by specifying `page` and `page_size` as query parameters when calling the endpoint, such as `https://<region>.data.tidbcloud.com/api/v1beta/app/<App ID>/endpoint/my_endpoint/get_id?page=<Page Number>&page_size=<Page Size>`. For more information, see [Call an endpoint](#call-an-endpoint).

    > **Note:**
    >
    > - If you do not include the `page` and `page_size` parameters in the request, the default behavior is to return the maximum number of rows specified in the **Max Rows** property on a single page.
    > - The `page_size` must be less than or equal to the **Max Rows** property. Otherwise, an error is returned.

- **Cache Response**: this property is available only when the request method is `GET`. When **Cache Response** is enabled, TiDB Cloud Data Service can cache the response returned by your `GET` requests within a specified time-to-live (TTL) period.
- **Time-to-live(s)**: this property is available only when **Cache Response** is enabled. You can use it to specify the time-to-live (TTL) period in seconds for cached response. During the TTL period, if you make the same `GET` requests again, Data Service returns the cached response directly instead of fetching data from the target database again, which improves your query performance.
- **Batch Operation**: this property is visible only when the request method is `POST` or `PUT`. When **Batch Operation** is enabled, you can operate on multiple rows in a single request. For example, you can insert multiple rows of data in a single `POST` request by putting an array of data objects to the `items` field of an object in the `--data-raw` option of your curl command when [calling the endpoint](#call-an-endpoint).

    > **Note:**
    >
    > The endpoint with **Batch Operation** enabled supports both array and object formats for the request body: `[{dataObject1}, {dataObject2}]` and `{items: [{dataObject1}, {dataObject2}]}`. For better compatibility with other systems, it is recommended that you use the object format `{items: [{dataObject1}, {dataObject2}]}`.

### Write SQL statements

On the SQL editor of the endpoint details page, you can write and run the SQL statements for an endpoint. You can also simply type `--` followed by your instructions to let AI generate SQL statements automatically.

1. Select a cluster.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > Only clusters that are linked to the Data App are displayed in the drop-down list. To manage the linked clusters, see [Manage linked clusters](/tidb-cloud/data-service-manage-data-app.md#manage-linked-data-sources).

    On the upper part of the SQL editor, select a cluster on which you want to execute SQL statements from the drop-down list. Then, you can view all databases of this cluster in the **Schema** tab on the right pane.

2. Depending on your endpoint type, do one of the following to select a database:

    - Predefined system endpoints: on the upper part of the SQL editor, select the target database from the drop-down list.
    - Other endpoints: write a SQL statement to specify the target database in the SQL editor. For example, `USE database_name;`.

3. Write SQL statements.

    In the SQL editor, you can write statements such as table join queries, complex queries, and aggregate functions. You can also simply type `--` followed by your instructions to let AI generate SQL statements automatically.

    To define a parameter, you can insert it as a variable placeholder like `${ID}` in the SQL statement. For example, `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE id = ${ID}`. Then, you can click the **Params** tab on the right pane to change the parameter definition and test values. For more information, see [Parameters](#configure-parameters).

    When defining an array parameter, the parameter is automatically converted to multiple comma-separated values in the SQL statement. To make sure that the SQL statement is valid, you need to add parentheses (`()`) around the parameter in some SQL statements (such as `IN`). For example, if you define an array parameter `ID` with test value `1,2,3`, use `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE id IN (${ID})` to query the data.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > - The parameter name is case-sensitive.
    > - The parameter cannot be used as a table name or column name.

4. Run SQL statements.

    If you have inserted parameters in the SQL statements, make sure that you have set test values or default values for the parameters in the **Params** tab on the right pane. Otherwise, an error is returned.

### Configure parameters

On the right pane of the endpoint details page, you can click the **Params** tab to view and manage the parameters used in the endpoint.

In the **Definition** section, you can view and manage the following properties for a parameter:

- The parameter name: the name can only include letters, digits, and underscores (`_`) and must start with a letter or an underscore (`_`). **DO NOT** use `page` and `page_size` as parameter names, which are reserved for pagination of request results.
- **Required**: specifies whether the parameter is required in the request. For path parameters, the configuration is required and cannot be modified. For other parameters, the default configuration is not required.
- **Type**: specifies the data type of the parameter. For path parameters, only `STRING` and `INTEGER` are supported. For other parameters, `STRING`, `NUMBER`, `INTEGER`, `BOOLEAN`, and `ARRAY` are supported.

    When using a `STRING` type parameter, you do not need to add quotation marks (`'` or `"`). For example, `foo` is valid for the `STRING` type and is processed as `"foo"`, whereas `"foo"` is processed as `"\"foo\""`.

- **Enum Value**: (optional) specifies the valid values for the parameter and is available only when the parameter type is `STRING`, `INTEGER`, or `NUMBER`.

    - If you leave this field empty, the parameter can be any value of the specified type.
    - To specify multiple valid values, you can separate them with a comma (`,`). For example, if you set the parameter type to `STRING` and specify this field as `foo, bar`, the parameter value can only be `foo` or `bar`.

- **ItemType**: specifies the item type of an `ARRAY` type parameter.
- **Default Value**: specifies the default value of the parameter.

    - For `ARRAY` type, you need to separate multiple values with a comma (`,`).
    - Make sure that the value can be converted to the type of parameter. Otherwise, the endpoint returns an error.
    - If you do not set a test value for a parameter, the default value is used when testing the endpoint.
- **Location**: indicates the location of the parameter. This property cannot be modified.
    - For path parameters, this property is `Path`.
    - For other parameters, if the request method is `GET` or `DELETE`, this property is `Query`. If the request method is `POST` or `PUT`, this property is `Body`.

In the **Test Values** section, you can view and set test parameters. These values are used as the parameter values when you test the endpoint. Make sure that the value can be converted to the type of parameter. Otherwise, the endpoint returns an error.

### Rename

To rename an endpoint, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [**Data Service**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/data-service) page of your project.
2. In the left pane, click the name of your target Data App to view its endpoints.
3. Locate the endpoint you want to rename, click **...** > **Rename**., and enter a new name for the endpoint.

> **Note:**
>
> Predefined system endpoints do not support renaming.

## Test an endpoint

To test an endpoint, perform the following steps:

> **Tip:**
>
> If you have imported your Data App to Postman, you can also test endpoints of the Data App in Postman. For more information, see [Run Data App in Postman](/tidb-cloud/data-service-postman-integration.md).

1. Navigate to the [**Data Service**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/data-service) page of your project.
2. In the left pane, click the name of your target Data App to view its endpoints.
3. Click the name of the endpoint you want to test to view its details.
4. (Optional) If the endpoint contains parameters, you need to set test values before testing.

    1. On the right pane of the endpoint details page, click the **Params** tab.
    2. Expand the **Test Values** section and set test values for the parameters.

        If you do not set a test value for a parameter, the default value is used.

5. Click **Test** in the upper-right corner.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > Alternatively, you can also press <kbd>F5</kbd> to test the endpoint.

After testing the endpoint, you can see the response as JSON at the bottom of the page. For more information about the JSON response, refer to [Response of an endpoint](#response).

## Deploy an endpoint

> **Note:**
>
> If you have connected your Data App to GitHub with **Auto Sync & Deployment** enabled, any Data App changes you made in GitHub will be deployed in TiDB Cloud Data Service automatically. For more information, see [Deploy automatically with GitHub](/tidb-cloud/data-service-manage-github-connection.md).

To deploy an endpoint, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [**Data Service**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/data-service) page of your project.
2. In the left pane, click the name of your target Data App to view its endpoints.
3. Locate the endpoint you want to deploy, click the endpoint name to view its details, and then click **Deploy** in the upper-right corner.
4. If **Review Draft** is enabled for your Data App, a dialog is displayed for you to review the changes you made. You can choose whether to discard the changes based on the review.
5. Click **Deploy** to confirm the deployment. You will get the **Endpoint has been deployed** prompt if the endpoint is successfully deployed.

    On the right pane of the endpoint details page, you can click the **Deployments** tab to view the deployed history.

## Call an endpoint

To call an endpoint, you can send an HTTPS request to either an undeployed draft version or a deployed online version of the endpoint.

> **Tip:**
>
> If you have imported your Data App to Postman, you can also call endpoints of the Data App in Postman. For more information, see [Run Data App in Postman](/tidb-cloud/data-service-postman-integration.md).

### Prerequisites

Before calling an endpoint, you need to create an API key. For more information, refer to [Create an API key](/tidb-cloud/data-service-api-key.md#create-an-api-key).

### Request

TiDB Cloud Data Service generates code examples to help you call an endpoint. To get the code example, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [**Data Service**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/data-service) page of your project.
2. In the left pane, click the name of your target Data App to view its endpoints.
3. Locate the endpoint you want to call and click **...** > **Code Example**. The **Code Example** dialog box is displayed.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > Alternatively, you can also click the endpoint name to view its details and click **...** > **Code Example** in the upper-right corner.

4. In the dialog box, select the environment and authentication method that you want to use to call the endpoint, and then copy the code example.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > - The code examples are generated based on the properties and parameters of the endpoint.
    > - Currently, TiDB Cloud Data Service only provides the curl code example.

    - Environment: choose **Test Environment** or **Online Environment** depending on your need. **Online Environment** is available only after you deploy the endpoint.
    - Authentication method: choose **Basic Authentication** or **Digest Authentication**.
        - **Basic Authentication** transmits your API key as based64 encoded text.
        - **Digest Authentication** transmits your API key in an encrypted form, which is more secure.

      Compared with **Basic Authentication**, the curl code of **Digest Authentication** includes an additional `--digest` option.

    Here is an example of a curl code snippet for a `POST` request that enables **Batch Operation** and uses **Digest Authentication**:

    <SimpleTab>
    <div label="Test Environment">

    To call a draft version of the endpoint, you need to add the `endpoint-type: draft` header:

    ```bash
    curl --digest --user '<Public Key>:<Private Key>' \
     --request POST 'https://<region>.data.tidbcloud.com/api/v1beta/app/<App ID>/endpoint/<Endpoint Path>' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json'\
     --header 'endpoint-type: draft'
     --data-raw '{
      "items": [
        {
          "age": "${age}",
          "career": "${career}"
        }
      ]
    }'
    ```

    </div>

    <div label="Online Environment">

    You must deploy your endpoint first before checking the code example in the online environment.

    To call the current online version of the endpoint, use the following command:

    ```bash
    curl --digest --user '<Public Key>:<Private Key>' \
     --request POST 'https://<region>.data.tidbcloud.com/api/v1beta/app/<App ID>/endpoint/<Endpoint Path>' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json'\
     --data-raw '{
      "items": [
        {
          "age": "${age}",
          "career": "${career}"
        }
      ]
    }'
    ```

    </div>
    </SimpleTab>

    > **Note:**
    >
    > - By requesting the regional domain `<region>.data.tidbcloud.com`, you can directly access the endpoint in the region where the TiDB cluster is located.
    > - Alternatively, you can also request the global domain `data.tidbcloud.com` without specifying a region. In this way, TiDB Cloud Data Service will internally redirect the request to the target region, but this might result in additional latency. If you choose this way, make sure to add the `--location-trusted` option to your curl command when calling an endpoint.

5. Paste the code example in your application, edit the example according to your need, and then run it.

    - You need to replace the `<Public Key>` and `<Private Key>` placeholders with your API key. For more information, refer to [Manage an API key](/tidb-cloud/data-service-api-key.md).
    - If the request method of your endpoint is `GET` and **Pagination** is enabled for the endpoint, you can paginate the results by updating the values of `page=<Page Number>` and `page_size=<Page Size>` with your desired values. For example, to get the second page with 10 items per page, use `page=2` and `page_size=10`.
    - If the request method of your endpoint is `POST` or `PUT`, fill in the `--data-raw` option according to the rows of data that you want to operate on.

        - For endpoints with **Batch Operation** enabled, the `--data-raw` option accepts an object with an `items` field containing an array of data objects so you can operate on multiple rows of data using one endpoint.
        - For endpoints with **Batch Operation** not enabled, the `--data-raw` option only accepts one data object.

    - If the endpoint contains parameters, specify the parameter values when calling the endpoint.

### Response

After calling an endpoint, you can see the response in JSON format. For more information, see [Response and Status Codes of Data Service](/tidb-cloud/data-service-response-and-status-code.md).

## Undeploy an endpoint

> **Note:**
>
> If you have [connected your Data App to GitHub](/tidb-cloud/data-service-manage-github-connection.md) with **Auto Sync & Deployment** enabled, undeploying an endpoint of this Data App will also delete the configuration of this endpoint on GitHub.

To undeploy an endpoint, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [**Data Service**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/data-service) page of your project.
2. In the left pane, click the name of your target Data App to view its endpoints.
3. Locate the endpoint you want to undeploy, click **...** > **Undeploy**.
4. Click **Undeploy** to confirm the undeployment.

## Delete an endpoint

> **Note:**
>
> Before you delete an endpoint, make sure that the endpoint is not online. Otherwise, the endpoint cannot be deleted. To undeploy an endpoint, refer to [Undeploy an endpoint](#undeploy-an-endpoint).

To delete an endpoint, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [**Data Service**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/data-service) page of your project.
2. In the left pane, click the name of your target Data App to view its endpoints.
3. Click the name of the endpoint you want to delete, and then click **...** > **Delete** in the upper-right corner.
4. Click **Delete** to confirm the deletion.
