# Serverless Tier Limitations

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD026 -->

This document describes the limitations of Serverless Tier.

We are constantly filling in the feature gaps between Serverless Tier and Dedicated Tier. If you require these features or capabilities in the gap, use [Dedicated Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#dedicated-tier) or [contact us](https://www.pingcap.com/contact-us/?from=en) for a feature request.

## General limitations

- For each TiDB Cloud account, you can create a maximum of five complimentary Serverless Tier clusters during the beta phase.
- Each Serverless Tier cluster has the following limitations:
    - The storage size is limited to 5 GiB (logical size) of OLTP storage and 5 GiB (logical size) of OLAP storage.
    - The compute resource is limited to 1 vCPU and 1 GiB RAM.
    - **Note**: In the coming months, we intend to offer a usage-based billing plan for additional resources and higher performance, while still keeping offering the free starter plan. In the coming releases, the limitations of the free Serverless Tier might be changed.
