# Create a TiDB Serverless Cluster

This document describes how to create a TiDB Serverless cluster in the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com/).

> **Tip:**
>
> To learn how to create a TiDB Dedicated cluster, see [Create a TiDB Dedicated Cluster](/tidb-cloud/create-tidb-cluster.md).

## Before you begin

If you do not have a TiDB Cloud account, click [here](https://tidbcloud.com/signup) to sign up for an account.

- You can either sign up with email and password so that you can manage your password using TiDB Cloud, or sign up with your Google, GitHub, or Microsoft account.
- For AWS Marketplace users, you can also sign up through AWS Marketplace. To do that, search for `TiDB Cloud` in [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace), subscribe to TiDB Cloud, and then follow the onscreen instructions to set up your TiDB Cloud account.
- For Google Cloud Marketplace users, you can also sign up through Google Cloud Marketplace. To do that, search for `TiDB Cloud` in [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace), subscribe to TiDB Cloud, and then follow the onscreen instructions to set up your TiDB Cloud account.

## Steps

If you are in the `Organization Owner` or the `Project Owner` role, you can create a TiDB Serverless cluster as follows:

1. Log in to the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com/), and then navigate to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page.

2. Click **Create Cluster**.

3. On the **Create Cluster** page, **Serverless** is selected by default.

4. The cloud provider of TiDB Serverless is AWS. You can select an AWS region where you want to host your cluster.

5. Select **Cluster Plan**. TiDB Serverless has two [Cluster Plans](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#cluster-plans). You can start with Free Cluster and later update to Scalable Cluster as your needs grow. If you want to create a scalable cluster, you need to set a spending limit and add a credit card.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > For each organization in TiDB Cloud, you can create a maximum of five Free Clusters by default. To create more TiDB Serverless clusters, you need to add a credit card and create [Scalable Clusters](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#scalable-clusters) for the usage.

6. Update the default cluster name if necessary, and then click **Create**.

    The cluster creation process starts and your TiDB Cloud cluster will be created in approximately 30 seconds.

## What's next

After your cluster is created, follow the instructions in [Connect to TiDB Serverless via Public Endpoint](/tidb-cloud/connect-via-standard-connection-serverless.md) to create a password for your cluster.

> **Note:**
>
> If you do not set a password, you cannot connect to the cluster.
