# Import Sample Data

This document describes how to import the sample data into TiDB Cloud via the UI. The sample data used is the system data from Capital Bikeshare, released under the Capital Bikeshare Data License Agreement. Before importing the sample data, you need to have one TiDB cluster.

<SimpleTab>
<div label="AWS">

1. Open the **Import** page for your target cluster.

    1. Log in to the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com/) and navigate to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page of your project.

        > **Tip:**
        >
        > If you have multiple projects, you can click <MDSvgIcon name="icon-left-projects" /> in the lower-left corner and switch to another project.

    2. Click the name of your target cluster to go to its overview page, and then click **Import** in the left navigation pane.

2. Configure the source data information. On the **Import** page:

    - For a TiDB Dedicated cluster, click **Import Data** in the upper-right corner.
    - For a TiDB Serverless cluster, click the **import data from S3** link above the upload area.

    Fill in the following parameters:

    - **Data format**: select **SQL File**. TiDB Cloud supports importing compressed files in the following formats: `.gzip`, `.gz`, `.zstd`, `.zst` and `.snappy`. If you want to import compressed SQL files, name the files in the `${db_name}.${table_name}.${suffix}.sql.${compress}` format, in which `${suffix}` is optional and can be any integer such as '000001'. For example, if you want to import the `trips.000001.sql.gz` file to the `bikeshare.trips` table, you can rename the file as `bikeshare.trips.000001.sql.gz`. Note that you only need to compress the data files, not the database or table schema files. The Snappy compressed file must be in the [official Snappy format](https://github.com/google/snappy). Other variants of Snappy compression are not supported.
    - **Bucket URI**: enter the sample data URI `s3://tidbcloud-sample-data/data-ingestion/`
    - **Bucket Access**: for the sample data, you can only use a Role ARN to access its bucket. For your own data, you can use either an AWS access key or a Role ARN to access your bucket.
        - **AWS Access Keys**: skip this option for the sample data.
        - **AWS Role ARN**: enter `arn:aws:iam::801626783489:role/import-sample-access`

    If the region of the bucket is different from your cluster, confirm the compliance of cross region. Click **Next**.

3. You can choose to import into pre-created tables, or import schema and data from the source. When you import sample data, choose **Import schema and data from S3**.

    - **Import into pre-created tables** allows you to create tables in TiDB in advance and select the tables that you want to import data into. In this case, you can choose up to 1000 tables to import. You can click **SQL Editor** in the left navigation pane to create tables. For more information about how to use SQL Editor, see [Explore your data with AI-assisted SQL Editor](/tidb-cloud/explore-data-with-chat2query.md). 
    - **Import schema and data from S3** allows you to import SQL scripts for creating a table and import corresponding table data stored in S3 into TiDB.

4. Click **Start Import**.

    - **Bucket gsutil URI**: enter the sample data URI `gs://tidbcloud-samples-us-west1/`.
    - **Bucket Access**: you can use a GCS IAM Role to access your bucket. For more information, see [Configure GCS access](/tidb-cloud/config-s3-and-gcs-access.md#configure-gcs-access).

    If the region of the bucket is different from your cluster, confirm the compliance of cross region. Click **Next**.

3. You can choose to import into pre-created tables, or import schema and data from the source. When you import sample data, choose **Import schema and data from GCS**.

    - **Import into pre-created tables** allows you to create tables in TiDB in advance and select the tables that you want to import data into. In this case, you can choose up to 1000 tables to import. You can click **SQL Editor** in the left navigation pane to create tables. For more information about how to use SQL Editor, see [Explore Your Data with AI-Assisted SQL Editor](/tidb-cloud/explore-data-with-chat2query.md). 
    - **Import schema and data from GCS** allows you to import SQL scripts that create a table along with its corresponding data stored in GCS directly into TiDB.

4. Click **Start Import**.

</SimpleTab>

When the data import progress shows **Completed**, you have successfully imported the sample data and the database schema to your database in TiDB Cloud.

Once the cluster finishes the data importing process, you will get the sample data in your database.

After connecting to the cluster, you can run some queries in your terminal to check the result, for example:

1. Get the trip records starting at "12th & U St NW":

    ```sql
    use bikeshare;
    ```

    ```sql
    select * from `trips` where start_station_name='12th & U St NW' limit 10;
    ```

    ```sql
