# Analyze and Tune Performance

TiDB Cloud provides [Slow Query](#slow-query), [Statement Analysis](#statement-analysis), [Key Visualizer](#key-visualizer), and [Index Insight (beta)](#index-insight-beta) to analyze performance.

- Slow Query lets you search and view all slow queries in your TiDB cluster, and explore the bottlenecks of each slow query by viewing its execution plan, SQL execution information, and other details.

- Statement Analysis enables you to directly observe the SQL execution on the page, and easily locate performance problems without querying the system tables.

- Key Visualizer helps you observe TiDB's data access patterns and data hotspots.

- Index Insight provides you with meaningful and actionable index recommendations.

> **Note:**
>
> Currently, **Key Visualizer** and **Index Insight (beta)** are unavailable for [TiDB Serverless](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-serverless-beta) clusters.

## Slow Query

By default, SQL queries that take more than 300 milliseconds are considered as slow queries.

To view slow queries in a cluster, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the **Diagnosis** page of a cluster.

2. Click the **Slow Query** tab.

3. Click any slow query in the list to display its detailed execution information.

4. (Optional) You can filter slow queries based on the target time range, the related databases, and SQL keywords. You can also limit the number of slow queries to be displayed.

The results are displayed in the form of a table, and you can sort the results by different columns.

For more information, see [Slow Queries in TiDB Dashboard](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/dashboard-slow-query).

## Statement Analysis

To use the statement analysis, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the **Diagnosis** page of a cluster.

2. Click the **SQL Statement** tab.

3. Select the time period to be analyzed in the time interval box. Then you can get the execution statistics of SQL statements of all databases in this period.

4. (Optional) If you only care about certain databases, you can select the corresponding schema(s) in the next box to filter the results.

The results are displayed in the form of a table, and you can sort the results by different columns.

For more information, see [Statement Execution Details in TiDB Dashboard](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/dashboard-statement-details).

## Key Visualizer

> **Note:**
>
> Key Visualizer is only available for [TiDB Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-dedicated) clusters.

To view the key analytics, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the **Diagnosis** page of a cluster.

2. Click the **Key Visualizer** tab.

On the **Key Visualizer** page, a large heat map shows changes on access traffic over time. The average values ​​along each axis of the heat map are shown below and on the right side. The left side is the table name, index name and other information.

For more information, see [Key Visualizer](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/dashboard-key-visualizer).

## Index Insight (beta)

The Index Insight feature in TiDB Cloud provides powerful capabilities to optimize query performance by offering recommended indexes for slow queries that are not utilizing indexes effectively.

> **Note:**
>
> Index Insight is currently in beta and only available for [TiDB Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-dedicated) clusters.

For more information, see [Index Insight](/tidb-cloud/index-insight.md).
