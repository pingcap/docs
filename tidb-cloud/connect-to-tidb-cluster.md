# Connect to Your TiDB Dedicated Cluster

This document introduces the methods to connect to your TiDB Dedicated cluster.

> **Tip:**
>
> To learn how to connect to a TiDB Serverless cluster, see [Connect to Your TiDB Serverless Cluster](/tidb-cloud/connect-to-tidb-cluster-serverless.md).

After your TiDB Dedicated cluster is created on TiDB Cloud, you can connect to it via one of the following methods:

- [Connect via standard connection](/tidb-cloud/connect-via-standard-connection.md)

    The standard connection exposes a public endpoint with traffic filters, so you can connect to your TiDB cluster via a SQL client from your laptop. You can connect to your TiDB clusters using TLS, which ensures the security of data transmission from your applications to TiDB clusters.

- [Connect via private endpoint with AWS](/tidb-cloud/set-up-private-endpoint-connections.md) (recommended)

    For TiDB Dedicated clusters hosted on AWS, private endpoint connection provides a private endpoint to allow SQL clients in your VPC to securely access services over AWS PrivateLink, which provides highly secure and one-way access to database services with simplified network management.

- [Connect via private endpoint with Google Cloud](/tidb-cloud/set-up-private-endpoint-connections-on-google-cloud.md) (recommended)

    For TiDB Dedicated clusters hosted on Google Cloud, private endpoint connection provides a private endpoint to allow SQL clients in your VPC to securely access services over Google Cloud Private Service Connect, which provides highly secure and one-way access to database services with simplified network management.

- [Connect via VPC peering](/tidb-cloud/set-up-vpc-peering-connections.md)

    If you want lower latency and more security, set up VPC peering and connect via a private endpoint using a VM instance on the corresponding cloud provider in your cloud account.

- [Connect via built-in SQL Editor](/tidb-cloud/explore-data-with-chat2query.md)

    > **Note:**
    >
    > To use SQL Editor on [TiDB Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-dedicated) clusters, contact [TiDB Cloud support](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-support.md).

    If your cluster is hosted on AWS and the TiDB version of the cluster is v6.5.0 or later, you can use the AI-assisted SQL Editor in the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com/) to maximize your data value.

    In SQL Editor, you can either write SQL queries manually or simply press <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> on macOS (or <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> on Windows or Linux) to instruct [Chat2Query (beta)](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-glossary.md#chat2query) to generate SQL queries automatically. This enables you to run SQL queries against databases without a local SQL client. You can intuitively view the query results in tables or charts and easily check the query logs.

- [Connect via SQL Shell](/tidb-cloud/connect-via-sql-shell.md): to try TiDB SQL and test out TiDB's compatibility with MySQL quickly, or administer user privileges.

## What's next

After you have successfully connected to your TiDB cluster, you can [explore SQL statements with TiDB](/basic-sql-operations.md).
