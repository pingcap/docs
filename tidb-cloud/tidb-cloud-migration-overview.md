# Migration Overview

You can migrate data from a wide variety of data sources to TiDB Cloud. This document gives an overview of the data migration scenarios.

## Migrate from On-Premises MySQL-Compatible Databases

TiDB is highly compatible with MySQL. You can migrate data from any MySQL-compatible databases to TiDB Cloud smoothly. You can perform both full data migration and incremental data migration using Data Migration. For more information, [Migrate MySQL-Compatible Databases to TiDB Cloud Using Data Migration](/tidb-cloud/migrate-from-mysql-using-data-migration.md).

If your application uses MySQL shards for data storage, you can migrate these shards into TiDB Cloud as one table. For more information, see [Migrate and Merge MySQL Shards of Large Datasets to TiDB Cloud](/tidb-cloud/migrate-sql-shards.md).

## Migrate from Public Cloud Storage

### Configure Amazon S3 access and GCS access

If your source data is stored in Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets, before importing or migrating the data to TiDB Cloud, you need to configure access to the buckets. For more information, see [Configure Amazon S3 access and GCS access](/tidb-cloud/config-s3-and-gcs-access.md).

### Migrate MySQL-Compatible Databases to TiDB Cloud Using Data Migration

TiDB Cloud provides the Data Migration feature, which supports full migration and incremental migration, allowing you to migrate your business data from the upstream database to TiDB Cloud with minimal downtime. For more information, see [Migrate MySQL-Compatible Databases to TiDB Cloud Using Data Migration](/tidb-cloud/migrate-from-mysql-using-data-migration.md).

### Migrate from Amazon Aurora MySQL to TiDB Cloud in bulk

You can migrate data from Amazon Aurora MySQL to TiDB Cloud in bulk using the import tools in the TiDB Cloud console.

For more information, see [Migrate from Amazon Aurora MySQL to TiDB Cloud in Bulk](/tidb-cloud/migrate-from-aurora-bulk-import.md).

### Import or migrate from Amazon S3 or GCS to TiDB Cloud

You can use Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as a staging area for importing or migrating data into TiDB Cloud.

For more information, see [Import or Migrate from Amazon S3 or GCS to TiDB Cloud](/tidb-cloud/migrate-from-amazon-s3-or-gcs.md).

### Migrate data from files to TiDB Cloud

- [Import CSV Files from Amazon S3 or GCS into TiDB Cloud](/tidb-cloud/import-csv-files.md)
- [Import Apache Parquet Files from Amazon S3 or GCS into TiDB Cloud](/tidb-cloud/import-parquet-files.md)

## Troubleshoot access denied errors during data import from Amazon S3

You can troubleshoot access denied errors that might occur when you import data from Amazon S3 into TiDB Cloud. For more information, see [Troubleshoot Access Denied Errors during Data Import from Amazon S3](/tidb-cloud/troubleshoot-import-access-denied-error.md).
