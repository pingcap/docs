# Migration and Import Overview

You can migrate data from a wide variety of data sources to TiDB Cloud. This document gives an overview of the data migration scenarios.

## Migrate data from MySQL-Compatible databases

When you migrate data from a MySQL-compatible database, you can perform full data migration and incremental data migration. The migration scenarios and methods are as follows:

- Migrate MySQL-compatible databases using Data Migration

    TiDB is highly compatible with MySQL. You can use Data Migration in the TiDB Cloud console to migrate data from any MySQL-compatible databases to TiDB Cloud smoothly. For more information, see [Migrate MySQL-Compatible Databases to TiDB Cloud Using Data Migration](/tidb-cloud/migrate-from-mysql-using-data-migration.md).

- Migrate using AWS DMS

    If you want to migrate heterogeneous databases, such as PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server to TiDB Cloud, it is recommended to use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS).

    - [Migrate from Amazon RDS for Oracle Using AWS DMS](/tidb-cloud/migrate-from-oracle-using-aws-dms.md)

- Migrate and merge MySQL shards

    If your application uses MySQL shards for data storage, you can migrate these shards into TiDB Cloud as one table. For more information, see [Migrate and Merge MySQL Shards of Large Datasets to TiDB Cloud](/tidb-cloud/migrate-sql-shards.md).

- Migrate from TiDB Self-Hosted

    You can migrate data from your TiDB Self-Hosted clusters to TiDB Cloud (AWS) through Dumpling and TiCDC. For more information, see [Migrate from TiDB Self-Hosted to TiDB Cloud](/tidb-cloud/migrate-from-op-tidb.md).

## Import data from files to TiDB Cloud

If you have data files in SQL, CSV, Parquet, or Aurora Snapshot formats, you can import these files to TiDB Cloud in one go. The import scenarios and methods are as follows:

- Import a local CSV file to TiDB Cloud

    You can import a local CSV file to TiDB Cloud. For more information, see [Import Local Files to TiDB Cloud](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-import-local-files.md).

- Import sample data (SQL file) to TiDB Cloud

    You can import sample data (SQL file) to TiDB Cloud to quickly get familiar with the TiDB Cloud interface and the import process. For more information, see [Import Sample Data to TiDB Cloud](/tidb-cloud/import-sample-data.md).

- Import CSV files from Amazon S3 or GCS into TiDB Cloud

    You can import CSV files from Amazon S3 or GCS into TiDB Cloud. For more information, see [Import CSV Files from Amazon S3 or GCS into TiDB Cloud](/tidb-cloud/import-csv-files.md).

- Import Apache Parquet files from Amazon S3 or GCS into TiDB Cloud

    You can import Parquet files from Amazon S3 or GCS into TiDB Cloud. For more information, see [Import Apache Parquet Files from Amazon S3 or GCS into TiDB Cloud](/tidb-cloud/import-parquet-files.md).

## Reference

### Configure Amazon S3 access and GCS access

If your source data is stored in Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets, before importing or migrating the data to TiDB Cloud, you need to configure access to the buckets. For more information, see [Configure Amazon S3 access and GCS access](/tidb-cloud/config-s3-and-gcs-access.md).

### Naming conventions for data import

To make sure that your data can be imported successfully, you need to prepare schema files and data files that conform to the naming conventions. For more information, see [Naming Conventions for Data Import](/tidb-cloud/naming-conventions-for-data-import.md).

### Troubleshoot access denied errors during data import from Amazon S3

You can troubleshoot access denied errors that might occur when you import data from Amazon S3 into TiDB Cloud. For more information, see [Troubleshoot Access Denied Errors during Data Import from Amazon S3](/tidb-cloud/troubleshoot-import-access-denied-error.md).
