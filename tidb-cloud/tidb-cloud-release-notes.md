    For more information, see [Import CSV Files from Amazon S3 or GCS into TiDB Cloud](/tidb-cloud/import-csv-files.md) and [Import Sample Data](/tidb-cloud/import-sample-data.md).

- Support AWS PrivateLink-powered endpoint connection as a new network access management option for TiDB Cloud [Serverless Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-serverless-beta) clusters.

    The private endpoint connection does not expose your data to the public internet. In addition, the endpoint connection supports CIDR overlap and is easier for network management.

    For more information, see [Set Up Private Endpoint Connections](/tidb-cloud/set-up-private-endpoint-connections.md).

**Console changes**

- Add new event types to the [**Event**](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-events.md) page to record backup, restore, and changefeed actions for [Dedicated Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-dedicated) clusters.

    To get a full list of the events that can be recorded, see [Logged events](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-events.md#logged-events).

- Introduce the **SQL Statement** tab on the [**SQL Diagnosis**](/tidb-cloud/tune-performance.md) page for [Serverless Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-serverless-beta) clusters.

    The **SQL Statement** tab provides the following:

    - A comprehensive overview of all SQL statements executed by your TiDB database, allowing you to easily identify and diagnose slow queries.
    - Detailed information on each SQL statement, such as the query time, execution plan, and the database server response, helping you optimize your database performance.
    - A user-friendly interface that makes it easy to sort, filter, and search through large amounts of data, enabling you to focus on the most critical queries.

  For more information, see [Statement Analysis](/tidb-cloud/tune-performance.md#statement-analysis).

## May 6, 2023

**General changes**

- Support directly accessing the [Data Service endpoint](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-glossary.md#endpoint) in the region where a TiDB [Serverless Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-serverless-beta) cluster is located.

    For newly created Serverless Tier clusters, the endpoint URL now includes the cluster region information. By requesting the regional domain `<region>.data.tidbcloud.com`, you can directly access the endpoint in the region where the TiDB cluster is located.

    Alternatively, you can also request the global domain `data.tidbcloud.com` without specifying a region. In this way, TiDB Cloud will internally redirect the request to the target region, but this might result in additional latency. If you choose this way, make sure to add the `--location-trusted` option to your curl command when calling an endpoint.

    For more information, see [Call an endpoint](/tidb-cloud/data-service-manage-endpoint.md#call-an-endpoint).

## April 25, 2023

**General changes**

- For the first five [Serverless Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-serverless-beta) clusters in your organization, TiDB Cloud provides a free usage quota for each of them as follows:

    - Row storage: 5 GiB
    - [Request Units (RUs)](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-glossary.md#request-unit): 50 million RUs per month

  Until May 31, 2023, Serverless Tier clusters are still free, with a 100% discount off. After that, usage beyond the free quota will be charged.

    You can easily [monitor your cluster usage or increase your usage quota](/tidb-cloud/manage-serverless-spend-limit.md#manage-spend-limit-for-tidb-serverless-clusters) in the **Usage This Month** area of your cluster **Overview** page. Once the free quota of a cluster is reached, the read and write operations on this cluster will be throttled until you increase the quota or the usage is reset upon the start of a new month.

    For more information about the RU consumption of different resources (including read, write, SQL CPU, and network egress), the pricing details, and the throttled information, see [TiDB Cloud Serverless Tier Pricing Details](https://www.pingcap.com/tidb-cloud-serverless-pricing-details).
