# TiDB Cloud Release Notes in 2025

This page lists the release notes of [TiDB Cloud](https://www.pingcap.com/tidb-cloud/) in 2025.

## October 28, 2025

**General changes**

- **TiDB Cloud Starter and TiDB Cloud Essential**

    To improve connection stability and prevent unexpected disconnections during TiDB server restarts or maintenance, it is recommended that you set the maximum lifetime of your database connections to less than 30 minutes.

    For more information, see [Configure the lifetime of connections](/develop/dev-guide-connection-parameters.md#configure-the-lifetime-of-connections).

**API changes**

- **TiDB Cloud Dedicated**

    Introduce the following [TiDB Cloud Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-cloud-dedicated) API endpoints for managing third-party monitoring integrations:

    - List integrations
    - Create an integration
    - Delete an integration

  For more information, see [TiDB Cloud Dedicated API](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/api/v1beta1/dedicated/).

## October 21, 2025

**General changes**

- **TiDB Cloud Dedicated**

    - [TiDB Cloud Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-cloud-dedicated) enhances the private endpoint feature for [Changefeeds](/tidb-cloud/changefeed-overview.md) to simplify configuration, improve security, and provide greater flexibility for data sinks.

        - **Simplified configuration**: private endpoint creation is now independent of changefeed creation, allowing multiple changefeeds within the same project to share a single private endpoint, thereby reducing redundant configurations.
        - **Private link sinks for MySQL**: offers a more secure way to sink data to MySQL, and now also supports sinking data directly to another TiDB Cloud Dedicated cluster via private link.
        - **Custom domain support**: when using self-hosted Kafka services, you can configure custom domains for data sinks to enhance security and make advertised listener updates more flexible without requiring server restarts.

      For more information, see [Set Up Private Endpoint for Changefeeds](/tidb-cloud/set-up-sink-private-endpoint.md).

    - [Prometheus integrations (Preview)](/tidb-cloud/monitor-prometheus-and-grafana-integration.md) are now available for [TiDB Cloud Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-cloud-dedicated) clusters.

        TiDB Cloud now manages Prometheus integrations at the cluster level, offering more granular control and configuration. This feature enables you to seamlessly ship the metrics of your [TiDB Cloud Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-cloud-dedicated) cluster to Prometheus, allowing for advanced alerting in a unified platform.

        For more information, see [Integrate TiDB Cloud with Prometheus and Grafana](/tidb-cloud/monitor-prometheus-and-grafana-integration.md).

## October 14, 2025

**General changes**

- **TiDB Cloud Starter**

    - [TiDB Cloud Starter](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#starter) no longer supports database audit logging.

        Currently, only [TiDB Cloud Essential](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#essential) and [TiDB Cloud Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-cloud-dedicated) support database audit logging. Existing TiDB Cloud Starter clusters currently using database audit logging are not affected.

    - [TiDB Cloud Starter](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#starter) removes the in-place restore feature, which means you can no longer restore a backup directly to the same cluster. This change helps prevent accidental overwrites of active production data and potential data loss.

        To restore your data, you can [restore the backup to a new cluster](/tidb-cloud/backup-and-restore-serverless.md#perform-the-restore). After validating the restored data, switch your application to the new cluster. Previously restored data in existing clusters remains intact, and no action is required unless you perform a new restore.

        For safer restore and migration workflows with more control and flexibility, consider using [TiDB Cloud Essential](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#essential).

    - The [**Metrics**](/tidb-cloud/built-in-monitoring.md#view-the-metrics-page) page for [TiDB Cloud Starter](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#starter) adds the following metrics for faster diagnosis and capacity planning:

        - `Lock-wait (P95/P99)`: monitors lock wait time percentiles to surface contention hotspots.
        - `Idle Connection Duration (P99 incl. not/in txn)`: identifies long-lived idle connections, both in-transaction and not-in-transaction, to adjust pooler limits and timeouts.

- **TiDB Cloud Essential**

    - [TiDB Cloud Essential](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#essential) is in public preview on AWS <CustomContent language="en,zh">and Alibaba Cloud</CustomContent>.

        For applications experiencing growing workloads and needing scalability in real time, TiDB Cloud Essential provides the flexibility and performance to keep pace with your business growth.

        <CustomContent language="en,zh">

        For more information, see [TiDB Cloud Essential Now Available in Public Preview on AWS and Alibaba Cloud](https://www.pingcap.com/blog/tidb-cloud-essential-now-available-public-preview-aws-alibaba-cloud/).

        </CustomContent>

    - Database audit logging is now available in the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com) for TiDB Cloud Essential and supports customizing rotation settings.

        You can configure database audit logs to be stored in TiDB Cloud, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, or Alibaba Cloud OSS.

        Currently, this feature is in beta. For more information, see [Database Audit Logging for TiDB Cloud Essential](/tidb-cloud/essential-database-audit-logging.md).

    - TiDB Cloud Essential adds a new event `ResourceLimitation` that notifies you when Request Capacity Units (RCUs) consumption of your cluster reaches the configured maximum multiple times within one hour.

        Usage exceeding the limit might be throttled. To avoid service impact, consider increasing the maximum RCU.

        For more information about events, see [TiDB Cloud Cluster Events](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-events.md).

    - The [**Metrics**](/tidb-cloud/built-in-monitoring.md#view-the-metrics-page) page for [TiDB Cloud Essential](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#essential) adds the following metrics for faster diagnosis and capacity planning:

        - `Capacity vs Usage (RU/s)`: visualizes provisioned Request Unit (RU) capacity versus actual RU consumption to spot headroom and tune autoscaling.
        - `Lock-wait (P95/P99)`: monitors lock wait time percentiles to surface contention hotspots.
        - `Idle Connection Duration (P99 incl. not/in txn)`: identifies long-lived idle connections, both in-transaction and not-in-transaction, to adjust pooler limits and timeouts.

      For more information, see [TiDB Cloud Built-in Metrics](/tidb-cloud/built-in-monitoring.md).

## September 30, 2025

**General changes**

- **TiDB Cloud Dedicated**

    - Datadog and New Relic integrations are now generally available (GA) for [TiDB Cloud Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-cloud-dedicated) clusters.
  
        TiDB Cloud now manages Datadog and New Relic integrations at the cluster level, offering more granular control and configuration. This feature enables you to seamlessly ship the metrics of your [TiDB Cloud Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-cloud-dedicated) cluster to Datadog or New Relic, allowing for advanced alerting in a unified platform.
  
        For integration steps, see [Integrate TiDB Cloud with Datadog](/tidb-cloud/monitor-datadog-integration.md) and [Integrate TiDB Cloud with New Relic](/tidb-cloud/monitor-new-relic-integration.md).
