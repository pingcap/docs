# TiDB Cloud Release Notes in 2024

This page lists the release notes of [TiDB Cloud](https://www.pingcap.com/tidb-cloud/) in 2024.

## November 26, 2024

**General changes**

- Upgrade the default TiDB version of new [TiDB Cloud Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-cloud-dedicated) clusters from [v7.5.4](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.5/release-7.5.4) to [v8.1.1](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/release-8.1.1).

- [TiDB Cloud Serverless](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-cloud-serverless) reduces costs for large data writes by up to 80% for the following scenarios:

    - When you perform write operations larger than 16 MiB in [autocommit mode](/transaction-overview.md#autocommit).
    - When you perform write operations larger than 16 MiB in [optimistic transaction model](/optimistic-transaction.md).
    - When you [import data into TiDB Cloud](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-migration-overview.md#import-data-from-files-to-tidb-cloud).

  This improvement enhances the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of your data operations, providing greater savings as your workload scales.

## November 19, 2024

**General changes**

- [TiDB Cloud Serverless branching (beta)](/tidb-cloud/branch-overview.md) introduces the following improvements to branch management:

    - **Flexible branch creation**: When creating a branch, you can select a specific cluster or branch as the parent and specify a precise point in time to use from the parent. This gives you precise control over the data in your branch.

    - **Branch reset**: You can reset a branch to synchronize it with the latest state of its parent.

    - **Improved GitHub integration**: The [TiDB Cloud Branching](https://github.com/apps/tidb-cloud-branching) GitHub App introduces the [`branch.mode`](/tidb-cloud/branch-github-integration.md#branchmode) parameter, which controls the behavior during pull request synchronization. In the default mode `reset`, the app resets the branch to match the latest changes in the pull request.

  For more information, see [Manage TiDB Cloud Serverless Branches](/tidb-cloud/branch-manage.md) and [Integrate TiDB Cloud Serverless Branching (Beta) with GitHub](/tidb-cloud/branch-github-integration.md).

- [Data Service (beta)](https://tidbcloud.com/console/data-service) supports configuring a custom domain to access endpoints in a Data App.

    By default, TiDB Cloud Data Service provides a domain `<region>.data.tidbcloud.com` to access each Data App's endpoints. For enhanced personalization and flexibility, you can now configure a custom domain for your Data App instead of using the default domain. This feature enables you to use branded URLs for your database services and enhances security.

    For more information, see [Custom domain in Data Service](/tidb-cloud/data-service-custom-domain.md).
