- Support [Organization SSO](https://tidbcloud.com/console/preferences/authentication) to streamline enterprise authentication processes.

    With this feature, you can seamlessly integrate TiDB Cloud with any identity provider (IdP) using [Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language) or [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/).

- The dual region backup feature for [TiDB Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-dedicated) is now in General Availability (GA).

    By using this feature, you can replicate backups across geographic regions within AWS/Google Cloud. This feature provides an additional layer of data protection and disaster recovery capabilities.
