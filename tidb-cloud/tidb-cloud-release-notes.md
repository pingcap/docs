# TiDB Cloud Release Notes in 2023

This page lists the release notes of [TiDB Cloud](https://www.pingcap.com/tidb-cloud/) in 2023.

## March 21, 2023

**General changes**

- Introduce [Data Service (beta)](https://tidbcloud.com/console/dataservice) for [Serverless Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#serverless-tier-beta) clusters, which enables you to access data via an HTTPS request using a custom API endpoint.

    With Data Service, you can seamlessly integrate TiDB Cloud with any application or service that is compatible with HTTPS. The following are some common scenarios:

    - Access the database of your TiDB cluster directly from a mobile or web application.
    - Use serverless edge functions to call endpoints and avoid scalability issues caused by database connection pooling.
    - Integrate TiDB Cloud with data visualization projects by using Data Service as a data source.
    - Connect to your database from an environment that MySQL interface does not support.

    In addition, TiDB Cloud provides the [Chat2Query API](/tidb-cloud/use-chat2query-api.md), a RESTful interface that allows you to generate and execute SQL statements using AI.

    To access Data Service, navigate to the [**Data Service**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/dataservice) page in the left navigation pane. For more information, see the following documentation:

    - [Data Service Overview](/tidb-cloud/data-service-overview.md)
    - [Get Started with Data Service](/tidb-cloud/data-service-get-started.md)
    - [Get Started with Chat2Query API](/tidb-cloud/use-chat2query-api.md)

- Support decreasing the size of TiDB, TiKV, and TiFlash nodes to scale in a [Dedicated Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#dedicated-tier) cluster that is hosted on AWS and created after December 31, 2022.

    You can decrease the node size [via the TiDB Cloud console](/tidb-cloud/scale-tidb-cluster.md#change-node-size) or [via the TiDB Cloud API (beta)](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/api/v1beta#tag/Cluster/operation/UpdateCluster).

- Support a new GCP region for the [Data Migration](/tidb-cloud/migrate-from-mysql-using-data-migration.md) feature of [Dedicated Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#dedicated-tier) clusters: `Tokyo (asia-northeast1)`.

    The feature can help you migrate data from MySQL-compatible databases in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to your TiDB cluster easily and efficiently.

    For more information, see [Migrate MySQL-compatible databases to TiDB Cloud using Data Migration](/tidb-cloud/migrate-from-mysql-using-data-migration.md).

**Console changes**

- Introduce the **Events** page for [Dedicated Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#dedicated-tier) clusters, which provides the records of main changes to your cluster.

    On this page, you can view the event history for the last 7 days and track important details such as the trigger time and the user who initiated an action. For example, you can view events such as when a cluster was paused or who modified the cluster size.

    For more information, see [TiDB Cloud cluster events](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-events.md).

- Add the **Database Status** tab to the **Monitoring** page for [Serverless Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#serverless-tier-beta) clusters, which displays the following database-level metrics:

    - QPS Per DB
    - Average Query Duration Per DB
    - Failed Queries Per DB

  With these metrics, you can monitor the performance of individual databases, make data-driven decisions, and take actions to improve the performance of your applications.

  For more information, see [Monitoring metrics for Serverless Tier clusters](/tidb-cloud/built-in-monitoring.md).

## March 14, 2023

**General changes**

- Upgrade the default TiDB version of new [Dedicated Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#dedicated-tier) clusters from [v6.5.0](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/release-6.5.0) to [v6.5.1](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/release-6.5.1).

- Support modifying column names of the target table to be created by TiDB Cloud when uploading a local CSV file with a header row.

    When importing a local CSV file with a header row to a [Serverless Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#serverless-tier-beta) cluster, if you need TiDB Cloud to create the target table and the column names in the header row do not follow the TiDB Cloud column naming conventions, you will see a warning icon next to the corresponding column name. To resolve the warning, you can move the cursor over the icon and follow the message to edit the existing column names or enter new column names.

    For information about column naming conventions, see [Import local files](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-import-local-files.md#import-local-files).
