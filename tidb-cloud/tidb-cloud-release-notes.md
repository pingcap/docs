## April 1, 2025

**General changes**

- The [TiDB Node Groups](/tidb-cloud/tidb-node-group-overview.md) feature is now generally available (GA) for [TiDB Cloud Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-cloud-dedicated) clusters hosted on AWS and Google Cloud.

    This feature enables **fine-grained computing resource isolation** within a single cluster, helping you optimize performance and resource allocation for multi-tenant or multi-workload scenarios.

    **Key benefits:**

    - **Resource isolation**:

        - Group TiDB nodes into logically isolated units, ensuring workloads in one group do not affect other groups.
        - Prevent resource contention between applications or business units.

    - **Simplified management**:

        - Manage all node groups within a single cluster, reducing operational overhead.
        - Scale groups independently based on demand.

  For more information about the benefits, see [the technical blog](https://www.pingcap.com/blog/tidb-cloud-node-groups-scaling-workloads-predictable-performance/). To get started, see [Manage TiDB Node Groups](/tidb-cloud/tidb-node-group-management.md).

- Introduce the [Standard storage](/tidb-cloud/size-your-cluster.md#standard-storage) type for TiKV nodes in [TiDB Cloud Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-cloud-dedicated) clusters hosted on AWS.

    The Standard storage type is ideal for most workloads, providing a balance between performance and cost efficiency.

    **Key benefits:**

    - **Improved performance**: Reserves sufficient disk resources for Raft logs, reducing I/O contention between Raft and data storage, thereby improving both the read and write performance of TiKV.
    - **Enhanced stability**: Isolates critical Raft operations from data workloads, ensuring more predictable performance.
    - **Cost efficiency**: Delivers higher performance at a competitive price compared with the previous storage type.

    **Availability:**

    The Standard storage type is automatically applied to new [TiDB Cloud Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-cloud-dedicated) clusters created on or after April 1, 2025, hosted on AWS, with supported versions (versions >= 7.5.5, 8.1.2, or 8.5.0). Existing clusters still use the previous [Basic storage](/tidb-cloud/size-your-cluster.md#basic-storage) type, and no migration is needed.

    The price of the Standard storage differs from that of the Basic storage. For more information, see [Pricing](https://www.pingcap.com/tidb-dedicated-pricing-details/).

## March 25, 2025

- Support connecting [TiDB Cloud Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-cloud-dedicated) clusters to generic Kafka in AWS and Google Cloud through Private Connect (beta).

    Private Connect leverages Private Link or Private Service Connect technologies from cloud providers to enable changefeeds in the TiDB Cloud VPC to connect to Kafka in customers' VPCs using private IP addresses, as if those Kafkas were hosted directly within the TiDB Cloud VPC. This feature helps prevent VPC CIDR conflicts and meets security compliance requirements.

    - For Apache Kafka in AWS, follow the instructions in [Set Up Self-Hosted Kafka Private Link Service in AWS](/tidb-cloud/setup-self-hosted-kafka-private-link-service.md) to configure the network connection.

    - For Apache Kafka in Google Cloud, follow the instructions in [Set Up Self-Hosted Kafka Private Service Connect in Google Cloud](/tidb-cloud/setup-self-hosted-kafka-private-service-connect.md) to configure the network connection.
  
  Note that using this feature incurs additional [Private Data Link costs](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-billing-ticdc-rcu.md#private-data-link-cost).

    For more information, see [Changefeed Sink to Apache Kafka](/tidb-cloud/changefeed-sink-to-apache-kafka.md#network).

- Introduce additional configurable options for Kafka changefeeds:

    - Support using the Debezium protocol. Debezium is a tool for capturing database changes. It converts each captured database change into a message called an event, and sends these events to Kafka. For more information, see [TiCDC Debezium Protocol](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/ticdc-debezium).

    - Support defining a single partition dispatcher for all tables, or different partition dispatchers for different tables. 

    - Introduce two new dispatcher types for the partition distribution of Kafka messages: timestamp and column value.

  For more information, see [Sink to Apache Kafka](/tidb-cloud/changefeed-sink-to-apache-kafka.md).

- Enhance roles in TiDB Cloud:

    - Introduce the `Project Viewer` and `Organization Billing Viewer` roles to enhance granular access control on TiDB Cloud.

    - Rename the following roles:

        - `Organization Member` to `Organization Viewer`
        - `Organization Billing Admin` to `Organization Billing Manager`
        - `Organization Console Audit Admin` to `Organization Console Audit Manager`

  For more information, see [Identity Access Management](/tidb-cloud/manage-user-access.md#organization-roles).

- Regional high availability (beta) for [TiDB Cloud Serverless](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-cloud-serverless) clusters.

    This feature is designed for workloads that require maximum infrastructure redundancy and business continuity. Key functions include:

    - Nodes are distributed across multiple availability zones to ensure high availability in the event of a zone failure.
    - Critical OLTP (Online Transactional Processing) components, such as PD and TiKV, are replicated across availability zones for redundancy.
    - Automatic failover minimizes service disruption during a primary zone failure.
  
  This feature is currently available only in the AWS Tokyo (ap-northeast-1) region and can be enabled only during cluster creation.
  
    For more information, see [High Availability in TiDB Cloud Serverless](/tidb-cloud/serverless-high-availability.md).

- Upgrade the default TiDB version of new [TiDB Cloud Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-cloud-dedicated) clusters from [v8.1.1](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-8.1.1) to [v8.1.2](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-8.1.2).

**Console changes**

- Strengthen the data export service:

    - Support exporting data from [TiDB Cloud Serverless](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-cloud-serverless) to Google Cloud Storage and Azure Blob Storage through the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com/).

    - Support exporting data in Parquet files through the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com/).
