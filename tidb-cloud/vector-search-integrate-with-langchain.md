# Integrate Vector Search with LangChain

This tutorial demonstrates how to integrate the [vector search](/tidb-cloud/vector-search-overview.md) feature in TiDB Cloud with [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/).

> **Note**
>
> - TiDB Vector Search is currently in beta and only available for [TiDB Serverless](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-serverless) clusters.
> - You can view the complete [sample code](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/docs/docs/integrations/vectorstores/tidb_vector.ipynb) on Jupyter Notebook, or run the sample code directly in the [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/docs/docs/integrations/vectorstores/tidb_vector.ipynb) online environment.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need:

- [Python 3.8 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) installed.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
- A TiDB Serverless cluster. Follow [creating a TiDB Serverless cluster](/tidb-cloud/create-tidb-cluster-serverless.md) to create your own TiDB Cloud cluster if you don't have one.

## Get started

This section provides step-by-step instructions for integrating TiDB Vector Search with LangChain to perform semantic searches.

### Step 1. Create a new Jupyter Notebook file

In your preferred directory, create a new Jupyter Notebook file named `integrate_with_langchain.ipynb`:

```shell
touch integrate_with_langchain.ipynb
```

### Step 2. Install required dependencies

In your project directory, run the following command to install the required packages:

```shell
!pip install langchain langchain-community
!pip install langchain-openai
!pip install pymysql
!pip install tidb-vector
```

Open the `integrate_with_langchain.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and add the following code to import the required packages:

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_community.vectorstores import TiDBVectorStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter
```

### Step 3. Set up your environment

#### Step 3.1 Obtain the connection string to the TiDB cluster

1. Navigate to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page, and then click the name of your target cluster to go to its overview page.

2. Click **Connect** in the upper-right corner. A connection dialog is displayed.

3. Ensure the configurations in the connection dialog match your operating environment.

    - **Endpoint Type** is set to `Public`.
    - **Branch** is set to `main`.
    - **Connect With** is set to `SQLAlchemy`.
    - **Operating System** matches your environment.

4. Click the **PyMySQL** tab and copy the connection string.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > If you have not set a password yet, click **Generate Password** to generate a random password.

#### Step 3.2 Configure environment variables

To establish a secure and efficient database connection, use the standard connection method provided by TiDB Cloud.

This document uses [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) as the embedding model provider. In this step, you need to provide the connection string obtained from step 3.1 and your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/step-2-set-up-your-api-key).

To configure the environment variables, run the following code. You will be prompted to enter your connection string and OpenAI API key:

```python
# Use getpass to securely prompt for environment variables in your terminal.
import getpass
import os

# Copy your connection string from the TiDB Cloud console.
# Connection string format: "mysql+pymysql://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>:4000/<DB>?ssl_ca=/etc/ssl/cert.pem&ssl_verify_cert=true&ssl_verify_identity=true"
tidb_connection_string = getpass.getpass("TiDB Connection String:")
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("OpenAI API Key:")
```

### Step 4. Load the sample document

#### Step 4.1 Download the sample document

In your project directory, create a directory named `data/how_to/` and download the sample document [`state_of_the_union.txt`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/docs/docs/how_to/state_of_the_union.txt) from the [langchain-ai/langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) GitHub repository.

```shell
!mkdir -p 'data/how_to/'
!wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/langchain-ai/langchain/master/docs/docs/how_to/state_of_the_union.txt' -O 'data/how_to/state_of_the_union.txt'
```

#### Step 4.2 Load and split the document

Load the sample document from `data/how_to/state_of_the_union.txt` and split it into chunks of approximately 1,000 characters each using a `CharacterTextSplitter`.

```python
loader = TextLoader("data/how_to/state_of_the_union.txt")
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
```

### Step 5. Embed and store document vectors

TiDB vector store supports both cosine distance (`consine`) and Euclidean distance (`l2`) for measuring similarity between vectors. The default strategy is cosine distance.

The following code creates a table named `embedded_documents` in TiDB, which is optimized for vector search.

```python
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vector_store = TiDBVectorStore.from_documents(
    documents=docs,
    embedding=embeddings,
    table_name="embedded_documents",
    connection_string=tidb_connection_string,
    distance_strategy="cosine",  # default, another option is "l2"
)
```

Upon successful execution, you can directly view and access the `embedded_documents` table in your TiDB database.

### Step 6. Perform a vector search

This step demonstrates how to query "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson" from the document `state_of_the_union.txt`.

```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
```

#### Option 1: Use `similarity_search_with_score()`

The `similarity_search_with_score()` method calculates the vector space distance between the documents and the query. This distance serves as a similarity score, determined by the chosen `distance_strategy`. The method returns the top `k` documents with the lowest scores. A lower score indicates a higher similarity between a document and your query.

```python
docs_with_score = vector_store.similarity_search_with_score(query, k=3)
for doc, score in docs_with_score:
   print("-" * 80)
   print("Score: ", score)
   print(doc.page_content)
   print("-" * 80)
```

And for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong.

As I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential.

While it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice.

And soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things.

So tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.

First, beat the opioid epidemic.

The `similarity_search_with_relevance_scores()` method returns the top `k` documents with the highest relevance scores. A higher score indicates a higher degree of similarity between a document and your query.

```python
docs_with_relevance_score = vector_store.similarity_search_with_relevance_scores(query, k=2)

### Use as a retriever

In Langchain, a [retriever](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#retrievers) is an interface that retrieves documents in response to an unstructured query, providing more functionality than a vector store. The following code demonstrates how to use TiDB vector store as a retriever.

```python
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(
   search_type="similarity_score_threshold",
   search_kwargs={"k": 3, "score_threshold": 0.8},
)
docs_retrieved = retriever.invoke(query)
for doc in docs_retrieved:
   print("-" * 80)
   print(doc.page_content)
   print("-" * 80)
```

The expected output is as follows:

```

```

### Remove the vector store

To remove an existing TiDB vector store, use the `drop_vectorstore()` method:

```python
vector_store.drop_vectorstore()
```

## Search with metadata filters

To refine your searches, you can use metadata filters to retrieve specific nearest-neighbor results that match the applied filters.

### Supported metadata types

Each document in the TiDB vector store can be paired with metadata, structured as key-value pairs within a JSON object. Keys are always strings, while values can be any of the following types:

- String
- Number: integer or floating point
- Boolean: `true` or `false`

For example, the following is a valid metadata payload:

```json
{
  "page": 12,
  "book_title": "Siddhartha"
}
```

### Metadata filter syntax

Available filters include the following:

- `$or`: Selects vectors that match any one of the specified conditions.
- `$and`: Selects vectors that match all the specified conditions.
- `$eq`: Equal to the specified value.
- `$ne`: Not equal to the specified value.
- `$gt`: Greater than the specified value.
- `$gte`: Greater than or equal to the specified value.
- `$lt`: Less than the specified value.
- `$lte`: Less than or equal to the specified value.
- `$in`: In the specified array of values.
- `$nin`: Not in the specified array of values.

If the metadata of a document is as follows:

```json
{
  "page": 12,
  "book_title": "Siddhartha"
}
```

The following metadata filters can match this document:

```json
{ "page": 12 }
```

```json
{ "page": { "$eq": 12 } }
```

```json
{
  "page": {
    "$in": [11, 12, 13]
  }
}
```

```json
{ "page": { "$nin": [13] } }
```

```json
{ "page": { "$lt": 11 } }
```

```json
{
  "$or": [{ "page": 11 }, { "page": 12 }],
  "$and": [{ "page": 12 }, { "page": 13 }]
}
```

Each key-value pair in the metadata filters is treated as a separate filter clause, and these clauses are combined using the `AND` logical operator.

### Example

The following example adds two documents to `TiDBVectorStore` and adds a `title` field to each document as the metadata:

```python
vector_store.add_texts(
    texts=[
        "TiDB Vector offers advanced, high-speed vector processing capabilities, enhancing AI workflows with efficient data handling and analytics support.",
        "TiDB Vector, starting as low as $10 per month for basic usage",
    ],
    metadatas=[
        {"title": "TiDB Vector functionality"},
        {"title": "TiDB Vector Pricing"},
    ],
)
```

The expected output is as follows:

```plain
[UUID('c782cb02-8eec-45be-a31f-fdb78914f0a7'),
 UUID('08dcd2ba-9f16-4f29-a9b7-18141f8edae3')]
```

Perform a similarity search with metadata filters:

```python
docs_with_score = vector_store.similarity_search_with_score(
    "Introduction to TiDB Vector", filter={"title": "TiDB Vector functionality"}, k=4
)
for doc, score in docs_with_score:
    print("-" * 80)
    print("Score: ", score)
    print(doc.page_content)
    print("-" * 80)
```

The expected output is as follows:

```plain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Score:  0.12761409169211535
TiDB Vector offers advanced, high-speed vector processing capabilities, enhancing AI workflows with efficient data handling and analytics support.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Advanced usage example: travel agent

This section demonstrates an advanced use case of integrating vector search with Langchain for a travel agent. The goal is to create personalized travel reports for clients seeking airports with specific amenities, such as clean lounges and vegetarian options.

The process involves two main steps:

1. Perform a semantic search across airport reviews to identify airport codes that match the desired amenities.
2. Execute an SQL query to merge these codes with route information, highlighting airlines and destinations that align with user's preferences.

### Prepare data

First, create a table to store airport route data:

```python
# Create table to store airplan data.
vector_store.tidb_vector_client.execute(
    """CREATE TABLE airplan_routes (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        airport_code VARCHAR(10),
        airline_code VARCHAR(10),
        destination_code VARCHAR(10),
        route_details TEXT,
        duration TIME,
        frequency INT,
        airplane_type VARCHAR(50),
        price DECIMAL(10, 2),
        layover TEXT
    );"""
)

# Insert some sample data into airplan_routes and the vector table.
vector_store.tidb_vector_client.execute(
    """INSERT INTO airplan_routes (
        airport_code,
        airline_code,
        destination_code,
        route_details,
        duration,
        frequency,
        airplane_type,
        price,
        layover
    ) VALUES
    ('JFK', 'DL', 'LAX', 'Non-stop from JFK to LAX.', '06:00:00', 5, 'Boeing 777', 299.99, 'None'),
    ('LAX', 'AA', 'ORD', 'Direct LAX to ORD route.', '04:00:00', 3, 'Airbus A320', 149.99, 'None'),
    ('EFGH', 'UA', 'SEA', 'Daily flights from SFO to SEA.', '02:30:00', 7, 'Boeing 737', 129.99, 'None');
    """
)
vector_store.add_texts(
    texts=[
        "Clean lounges and excellent vegetarian dining options. Highly recommended.",
        "Comfortable seating in lounge areas and diverse food selections, including vegetarian.",
        "Small airport with basic facilities.",
    ],
    metadatas=[
        {"airport_code": "JFK"},
        {"airport_code": "LAX"},
        {"airport_code": "EFGH"},
    ],
)
```

The expected output is as follows:

```plain
[UUID('6dab390f-acd9-4c7d-b252-616606fbc89b'),
 UUID('9e811801-0e6b-4893-8886-60f4fb67ce69'),
 UUID('f426747c-0f7b-4c62-97ed-3eeb7c8dd76e')]
```

### Perform a semantic search

The following code searches for airports with clean facilities and vegetarian options:

```python
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(
    search_type="similarity_score_threshold",
    search_kwargs={"k": 3, "score_threshold": 0.85},
)
semantic_query = "Could you recommend a US airport with clean lounges and good vegetarian dining options?"
reviews = retriever.invoke(semantic_query)
for r in reviews:
    print("-" * 80)
    print(r.page_content)
    print(r.metadata)
    print("-" * 80)
```

The expected output is as follows:

```plain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clean lounges and excellent vegetarian dining options. Highly recommended.
{'airport_code': 'JFK'}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comfortable seating in lounge areas and diverse food selections, including vegetarian.
{'airport_code': 'LAX'}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Retrieve detailed airport information

Extract airport codes from the search results and query the database for detailed route information:

```python
# Extracting airport codes from the metadata
airport_codes = [review.metadata["airport_code"] for review in reviews]

# Executing a query to get the airport details
search_query = "SELECT * FROM airplan_routes WHERE airport_code IN :codes"
params = {"codes": tuple(airport_codes)}

airport_details = vector_store.tidb_vector_client.execute(search_query, params)
airport_details.get("result")
```

The expected output is as follows:

```plain
[(1, 'JFK', 'DL', 'LAX', 'Non-stop from JFK to LAX.', datetime.timedelta(seconds=21600), 5, 'Boeing 777', Decimal('299.99'), 'None'),
 (2, 'LAX', 'AA', 'ORD', 'Direct LAX to ORD route.', datetime.timedelta(seconds=14400), 3, 'Airbus A320', Decimal('149.99'), 'None')]
```

### Streamline the process

Alternatively, you can streamline the entire process using a single SQL query:

```python
search_query = f"""
    SELECT
        VEC_Cosine_Distance(se.embedding, :query_vector) as distance,
        ar.*,
        se.document as airport_review
    FROM
        airplan_routes ar
    JOIN
        {TABLE_NAME} se ON ar.airport_code = JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT(se.meta, '$.airport_code'))
    ORDER BY distance ASC
    LIMIT 5;
"""
query_vector = embeddings.embed_query(semantic_query)
params = {"query_vector": str(query_vector)}
airport_details = vector_store.tidb_vector_client.execute(search_query, params)
airport_details.get("result")
```

The expected output is as follows:

```plain
[(0.1219207353407008, 1, 'JFK', 'DL', 'LAX', 'Non-stop from JFK to LAX.', datetime.timedelta(seconds=21600), 5, 'Boeing 777', Decimal('299.99'), 'None', 'Clean lounges and excellent vegetarian dining options. Highly recommended.'),
 (0.14613754359804654, 2, 'LAX', 'AA', 'ORD', 'Direct LAX to ORD route.', datetime.timedelta(seconds=14400), 3, 'Airbus A320', Decimal('149.99'), 'None', 'Comfortable seating in lounge areas and diverse food selections, including vegetarian.'),
 (0.19840519342700513, 3, 'EFGH', 'UA', 'SEA', 'Daily flights from SFO to SEA.', datetime.timedelta(seconds=9000), 7, 'Boeing 737', Decimal('129.99'), 'None', 'Small airport with basic facilities.')]
```

### Clean up

Finally, clean up the resources by dropping the created table:

```python
vector_store.tidb_vector_client.execute("DROP TABLE airplan_routes")
```

The expected output is as follows:

```plain
{'success': True, 'result': 0, 'error': None}
```
