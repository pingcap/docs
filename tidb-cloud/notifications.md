# Notifications in the TiDB Cloud Console

The [TiDB Cloud console](https://console.tidb.io/signup?provider_source=alicloud) provides notifications to keep you informed about important updates, system messages, product changes, billing reminders, and other relevant information. These notifications help you stay up-to-date and take necessary actions without leaving the console.

## Notification types

You might receive different types of notifications in the TiDB Cloud console, such as:

- **Informational notifications**

    Provide helpful updates, such as feature usage tips, application changes, or reminders for upcoming events.

- **Actionable notifications**

   Prompt you to perform specific actions, such as adding a credit card.

- **Alert notifications**

    Notify you of critical issues or urgent events requiring immediate attention, such as system errors, security warnings, or important updates.

- **Billing notifications**

    Deliver updates about billing-related activities, such as credit and discount updates.

- **Feedback notifications**

    Request feedback on your experience with a feature, such as rating a recent interaction or completing a survey.
