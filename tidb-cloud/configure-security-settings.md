# Configure Cluster Security Settings

When you create a cluster, the TiDB Cloud console will automatically guide you to configure the root password and allowed IP addresses to connect to your cluster.

If you do not configure the root password or allowed IP addresses at that time, or if you want to modify the cluster security settings, take the following steps:

1. In the TiDB Cloud console, navigate to the **Clusters** page of your project.
2. Locate your cluster, and click **Security Settings** in the upper-right corner of the cluster area. The **Security Settings** dialog is displayed.
3. In the dialog, configure the root password and allowed IP addresses.

    To allow your cluster to be accessible by any IP addresses, click **Allow Access from Anywhere**.

4. Click **Apply**.

> **Tip:**
>
> If you are viewing the overview page of your cluster, you can click the **...** in the upper-right corner of the page, select **Security Settings**, and configure these settings, too.
