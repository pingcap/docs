# Configure Cluster Password Settings

For TiDB Cloud Dedicated clusters, you can configure the root password and allowed IP addresses to connect to your cluster.

> **Note:**
>
> For TiDB Cloud Serverless clusters, this document is inapplicable and you can refer to [TLS Connection to TiDB Cloud Serverless](/tidb-cloud/secure-connections-to-serverless-clusters.md) instead.

1. In the TiDB Cloud console, navigate to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page of your project.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > You can use the combo box in the upper-left corner to switch between organizations, projects, and clusters.

2. In the row of your target cluster, click **...** and select **Password Settings**.
3. Set the root password to connect to your cluster, and then click **Save**.

    You can click **Auto-generate Password** to generate a random password. The generated password will not show again, so save your password in a secure location.

> **Tip:**
>
> If you are viewing the overview page of your cluster, you can click the **...** in the upper-right corner of the page, select **Password Settings**, and configure these settings, too.
