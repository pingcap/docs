## Delete a recovery group

When a recovery group is no longer needed to manage the replication of a set of databases, you can delete it from the system.

1. In the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com/), click <MDSvgIcon name="icon-left-projects" /> in the lower-left corner, switch to the target project if you have multiple projects, and then click **Project Settings**.

2. In the **Project Settings** navigation pane, click **Recovery Group**.

3. On the **Recovery Group** page, locate the name of the recovery group that you wish to delete.

4. Click the **Action** menu for the recovery group, and then click **Delete**. The deletion dialog is displayed.

    > **Warning**
    >
    > - Deleting a recovery group also removes all associated replication relationships associated with that recovery group. 
    > - The databases associated with the recovery group are no longer protected against disasters.

5. Confirm that you understand the impact of the deletion by typing the name of the recovery group and clicking **I understand, delete it**.
