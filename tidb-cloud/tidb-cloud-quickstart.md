# TiDB Cloud Quick Start

*Estimated completion time: 20 minutes*

This tutorial guides you through an easy way to get started with your TiDB Cloud. You can also navigate to the [**Getting Started**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/getting-started) page in the TiDB Cloud console to follow the tutorials step by step.

In addition, you can try out TiDB features on [TiDB Playground](https://play.tidbcloud.com/?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=tidb_cloud_quick_start).

## Step 1. Create a TiDB cluster

[TiDB Serverless](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-serverless-beta) (Beta) is the best way to get started with TiDB Cloud. To create a TiDB Serverless cluster, take the following steps:

1. If you do not have a TiDB Cloud account, click [here](https://tidbcloud.com/free-trial) to sign up for an account.

    You can either sign up with email and password so that you can manage your password using TiDB Cloud, or choose your Google, GitHub, or Microsoft account for single sign-on (SSO) to TiDB Cloud.

2. [Log in](https://tidbcloud.com/) to your TiDB Cloud account.

    The [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page is displayed by default.

3. For new sign-up users, TiDB Cloud creates a default TiDB Serverless cluster `Cluster0` for you automatically.

    - To try out TiDB Cloud features instantly with this default cluster, go to [Step 2. Try AI-powered Chat2Query (beta)](#step-2-try-ai-powered-chat2query-beta).
    - To try creating a new TiDB Serverless cluster on your own, take the following operations:

        1. Click **Create Cluster**.
        2. On the **Create Cluster** page, **Serverless** is selected by default. Select a target region of your cluster, update the default cluster name if necessary, and then click **Create**. Your TiDB Serverless cluster will be created in approximately 30 seconds.

## Step 2. Try AI-powered Chat2Query (beta)

TiDB Cloud is powered by AI. You can use Chat2Query (beta), an AI-powered SQL editor in the TiDB Cloud console, to maximize your data value.

In Chat2Query, you can either simply type `--` followed by your instructions to let AI generate SQL queries automatically or write SQL queries manually, and then run SQL queries against databases without a terminal.

1. On the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page, click a cluster name to go to its overview page, and then click **Chat2Query** in the left navigation pane.

2. To try TiDB Cloud AI capacity, follow the on-screen instructions to allow PingCAP and OpenAI to use your code snippets to research and improve the services, and then click **Save and Get Started**.

3. In the editor, you can either simply type `--` followed by your instructions to let AI generate SQL queries automatically or write SQL queries manually.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > SQL queries generated by AI are not 100% accurate and might still need your further tweak.

4. Run SQL queries.

1. Click **?** in the lower-right corner of the console and click **Interactive Tutorials**.
2. In the tutorials list, select a tutorial card to start. For example, **Steam Game Stats**.
3. Select a TiDB Serverless cluster that you want to use for the tutorial, and click **Import Dataset**. The import process might take approximately one minute.
4. After the sample data is imported, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the tutorial.
