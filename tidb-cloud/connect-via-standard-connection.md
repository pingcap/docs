# Connect to TiDB Dedicated via Public Connection

This document describes how to connect to your TiDB Dedicated cluster via public connection. The public connection exposes a public endpoint with traffic filters, so you can connect to your TiDB Dedicated cluster via a SQL client from your laptop.

> **Tip:**
>
> To learn how to connect to a TiDB Serverless cluster via public connection, see [Connect to TiDB Serverless via Public Endpoint](/tidb-cloud/connect-via-standard-connection-serverless.md).

## Prerequisite: Configure IP access list

For public connections, TiDB Dedicated only allows client connections from addresses in the IP access list. If you have not configured the IP access list, follow the steps in [Configure an IP Access List](/tidb-cloud/configure-ip-access-list.md) to configure it before your first connection.

## Connect to the cluster

To connect to a TiDB Dedicated cluster via public connection, take the following steps:

1. Open the overview page of the target cluster.

    1. Log in to the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com/) and navigate to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page of your project.

        > **Tip:**
        >
        > If you have multiple projects, you can click <MDSvgIcon name="icon-left-projects" /> in the lower-left corner and switch to another project.

    2. Click the name of your target cluster to go to its overview page.

2. Click **Connect** in the upper-right corner. A connection dialog is displayed.

3. In the connection dialog, select **Public** from the **Connection Type** drop-down list.

    If you have not configured the IP access list, click **Configure IP Access List** or follow the steps in [Configure an IP Access List](/tidb-cloud/configure-ip-access-list.md) to configure it before your first connection.

4. Click **CA cert** to download CA cert for TLS connection to TiDB clusters. The CA cert supports TLS 1.2 version by default.

5. Choose your preferred connection method, and then refer to the connection string and sample code on the tab to connect to your cluster.

After you have successfully connected to your TiDB cluster, you can [explore SQL statements with TiDB](/basic-sql-operations.md).
