# Connected: AI chat in IM

The AI chat in Instant Message (IM) powered by PingCAP, is an offering to invite TiDB AI assistant chatbot to specific IM channels for preliminary technical support and consultation. This service is based on Graph RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) built on top of [TiDB Vector Search](/tidb-cloud/vector-search-overview.md).

## Limitation

Currently, the ticket support feature for [Lark](https://www.larksuite.com/) is still in beta and is available upon request. If you are interested in trying this feature, contact TiDB Cloud support at <a href="mailto:support@pingcap.com">support@pingcap.com</a> or reach out to your Technical Account Manager (TAM).
