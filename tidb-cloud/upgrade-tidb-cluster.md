# Upgrade a TiDB Cluster

This document describes how to upgrade a TiDB cluster on TiDB Cloud. TiDB Cloud provides two upgrade mechanisms for upgrading your TiDB version.

## Regularly upgrade

For the TiDB version that is too low, TiDB Cloud will regularly upgrade it uniformly, and notify users via email before and after the upgrade.

## Contact support to upgrade

To submit an upgrade request, perform the steps in [TiDB Cloud Support](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-support.md) to contact our support team. Note to provide the following information in the **Description** box:

- Cloud Provider: GCP or AWS
- Cluster Name: xxx

TiDB Cloud technical support will confirm with you the time period for the upgrade. After you have confirmed the upgrade time, TiDB Cloud technical support will do the upgrade in the confirmed time period.
