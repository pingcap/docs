# Encryption at Rest Using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys

Customer-Managed Encryption Key (CMEK) lets you protect your static data in a TiDB Cloud Dedicated Tier using a cryptographic key that is completely controlled by you. This key is known as the CMEK key.

After you enable CMEK for a project, all clusters created within this project encrypt their static data using this CMEK key, and any backup data produced by these clusters is also encrypted using the same key. If you do not enable CMEK, TiDB Cloud uses an escrow key to encrypt all data in your cluster at rest.

> **Note:**

> Currently, this feature is only available upon request. If you need to try out this feature, contact [support](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-support.md).

## Restrictions

- Currently, TiDB Cloud only supports using AWS KMS to provide CMEK.
- To use CMEK, you need to enable CMEK when creating a project and complete CMEK-related configurations before creating a cluster. You cannot enable CMEK for existing projects.
- Currently, in CMEK-enabled projects, you can only create [Dedicated Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#dedicated-tier) clusters hosted on AWS. Dedicated Tier clusters hosted on GCP and [Serverless Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#serverless-tier-beta) clusters are not supported.
- Currently, for a specific project, you can only enable CMEK for one AWS region. Once you have configured it, you cannot create clusters in other regions within the same project.

## Enable CMEK

If you want to encrypt your data using the KMS owned by your account, take the following steps.

### Step 1. Provision KMS and IAM in your cloud provider

1. Create your CMEK Key on the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) console. Copy the KMS Key ARN. To learn how to create a key, see [Creating Keys](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html#create-symmetric-cmk) in the AWS documentation.

2. Create an IAM role and configure the role's access policy to CMEK.

    To make the TiDB cluster function as expected, you need to grant certain permissions to the TiDB account for accessing KMS. Note that this feature is in the development stage and the policy requirement could be subject to change as future features might require more permissions. Hereâ€™re the required permissions for supported features at present:

    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Id": "cmek-policy",
        "Statement": [
            // EBS-related policy
            {
                "Sid": "Allow access through EBS for all principals in the account that are authorized to use EBS",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "AWS": "*"
                },
                "Action": [
                    "kms:Encrypt",
                    "kms:Decrypt",
                    "kms:ReEncrypt*",
                    "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
                    "kms:CreateGrant",
                    "kms:DescribeKey"
                ],
                "Resource": "*",
                "Condition": {
                    "StringEquals": {
                        "kms:CallerAccount": "<pingcap-account>",
                        "kms:ViaService": "ec2.<region>.amazonaws.com"
                    }
                }
            },
            // S3-related policy
            {
                "Sid": "Allow TiDB cloud role to use KMS to store encrypted backup to S3",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<pingcap-account>:root"
                },
                "Action": [
                    "kms:Decrypt",
                    "kms:GenerateDataKey"
                ],
                "Resource": "*"
            },
            ... // user's own admin access to KMS
        ]
    }
    ```

> **Note:**
>
> - `<pingcap-account>` is the account where your clusters run in. If you do not know the account, contact [support](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-support.md).
> - `<region>` is the region where you want to create your cluster, for example, `us-west-2`. If you do not want to specify a region, replace `<region>` with a wildcard `*`, and put it in a `StringLike` block.
> - For EBS-related policy in the preceding block, refer to [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/conditions-kms.html#conditions-kms-caller-account).
> - For S3-related policy in the preceding block, refer to [AWS blog](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/s3-bucket-access-default-encryption).

### Step 2. Create a new project and enable CMEK

> **Note:**
>
> Currently, the CMEK configuration is not available on the TiDB Cloud console. You can only configure the project using TiDB Cloud API.

1. Create a new project and enable AWS CMEK using the [Create a project](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/api/v1beta#tag/Project/operation/CreateProject) endpoint of TiDB Cloud API.

    Make sure the `aws_cmek_enabled` field is set to `true`.

2. Configure the KMS Key ARN for the specified region (for example, us-east-1) under this project using the [Configure AWS CMEK](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/api/v1beta#tag/Cluster/operation/CreateAwsCmek) endpoint of TiDB Cloud API.

### Step 3. Create a cluster

Create a Dedicated Tier cluster hosted on AWS under the project created in Step 1. Ensure that the region where the cluster is located is the same as that in Step 2.

> **Note:**
>
> When CMEK is enabled, the EBS volumes used by the nodes of the cluster and the S3 used for the cluster backups are encrypted using CMEK.

## Rotate CMEK

You can configure [automatic CMEK rotation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html) on AWS KMS. With this rotation enabled, you do not need to update the Encryption at Rest project settings in TiDB Cloud, including the CMEK ID.

## Revoke and restore CMEK

If you need to temporarily revoke TiDB Cloud's access to CMEK, follow these steps:

1. On the AWS KMS console, revoke the corresponding permissions and update the KMS Key policy.
2. On the TiDB Cloud console, pause all the clusters in the project.

> **Note:**
>
> After you revoke CMEK on AWS KMS, your running clusters are not affected. However, when you pause a cluster and then restore the cluster, the cluster will not be able to restore normally because it cannot access CMEK.

After revoking TiDB Cloud's access to CMEK, if you need to restore the access, follow these steps:

1. On the AWS KMS console, restore the CMEK access policy.
2. On the TiDB Cloud console, restore all clusters in the project.
