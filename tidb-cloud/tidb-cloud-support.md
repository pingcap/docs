# TiDB Cloud Support

TiDB Cloud offers support services to your organization. To contact our support team, perform the following steps:

1. To accelerate the support process, it is recommended that you collect the following background information first.

    - Issue description
    - Organization ID
    - Project ID
    - Cluster ID
    - Operation duration

    If you do not know where to locate the IDs, take the following steps:

    - To get the organization ID and project ID, click the account name in the upper-right corner of the window, click **Organization Settings**, and then find the IDs on the **Organization Settings** page.

    - To get the cluster ID, go to the **Active Cluster** page, click the name of your cluster, and then find the ID in the browser URL. For example, if your browser URL of the cluster is `https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters/1379661944615594065`, the cluster ID is `1379661944615594065`.

2. Click **Support** on the upper right of the top navigation bar, and click **Request Support**. Or directly click the **Help** icon on the lower right.

3. In the **Leave us a message** dialog, fill in the ticket.

4. Click **Send** to submit your ticket. After the support team receives your ticket, they will reply to you via email.

5. Check your email to view the reply, your ticket history, and communication records.

    Before the ticket is closed, you can continue to communicate with the support team via either of the following two methods:
