# Delete a TiDB Cluster

This document describes how to delete a TiDB cluster on TiDB Cloud.

You can delete a cluster at any time by performing the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page of your project.
2. In the row of your target cluster to be deleted, click **...**.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > Alternatively, you can also click the name of the target cluster to go to its overview page, and then click **...** in the upper-right corner.

3. Click **Delete** in the drop-down menu.
4. In the cluster deleting window, confirm the deletion:

    - If you have at least one manual or automatic backup, you can see the number of backups and the charging policy for backups. Click **Continue** and enter `<organization name>/<project name>/<cluster name>`.
    - If you do not have any backups, just enter `<organization name>/<project name>/<cluster name>`.

    If you want to restore the cluster sometime in the future, make sure that you have a backup of the cluster. Otherwise, you cannot restore it anymore. For more information about how to back up TiDB Dedicated clusters, see [Back Up and Restore TiDB Dedicated Data](/tidb-cloud/backup-and-restore.md).

    > **Note:**
    >
    > [TiDB Serverless clusters](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-serverless) only support [in-place restoring from backups](/tidb-cloud/backup-and-restore-serverless.md#restore) and do not support restoring data after the deletion. If you want to delete a TiDB Serverless cluster and restore its data in the future, you can use [Dumpling](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/dumpling-overview) to export your data as a backup.

5. Click **I understand, delete it**.

    Once a backed up TiDB Dedicated cluster is deleted, the existing backup files of the cluster are moved to the recycle bin.

    - Automatic backups will expire and be automatically deleted once the retention period ends. The default retention period is 7 days if you don't modify it.
    - Manual backups will be kept in the Recycle Bin until manually deleted.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > Please be aware that backups will continue to incur charges until deleted.

    If you want to restore a TiDB Dedicated cluster from recycle bin, see [Restore a deleted cluster](/tidb-cloud/backup-and-restore.md#restore-a-deleted-cluster).
