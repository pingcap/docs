# TiDB Cloud CLI Quick Start

TiDB Cloud provides a command-line interface (CLI) [`ticloud`](https://github.com/tidbcloud/tidbcloud-cli) for you to interact with TiDB Cloud from your terminal with a few lines of commands. For example, you can easily perform the following operations using `ticloud`:

- Create, delete, and list your clusters.
- Import data from Amazon S3 or local files to your clusters.

## Before you begin

- Have a TiDB Cloud account. If you do not have one, [sign up for a free trial](https://tidbcloud.com/free-trial).
- [Create a TiDB Cloud API Key](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/api/v1beta#section/Authentication/API-Key-Management).

## Installation

For macOS or Linux, you can install `ticloud` using any of the following methods:

- Install via script (recommended)

    ```shell
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidbcloud/tidbcloud-cli/main/install.sh | sh
    ```

- Install via [TiUP](https://tiup.io/)

    ```shell
    tiup install cloud
    ```

- Install manually

    Download the pre-compiled binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/tidbcloud/tidbcloud-cli/releases/latest) page and copy them to your desired location for installation.

- Install in GitHub Actions

    To set up `ticloud` in GitHub Action, use [`setup-tidbcloud-cli`](https://github.com/tidbcloud/setup-tidbcloud-cli).

Install the MySQL command-line client if you do not have it. You can install it via your package manager:

- Debian-based distributions:

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install mysql-client
    ```

- RPM-based distributions:

    ```shell
    sudo yum install mysql
    ```
  
- macOS:

  ```shell
  brew install mysql-client
  ```

For Windows, you can install `ticloud` using either of the following methods:

- Install manually

    Download the pre-compiled binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/tidbcloud/tidbcloud-cli/releases/latest) page and copy them to the desired location for installation.

- Install in GitHub Actions

    To set up `ticloud` in GitHub Actions, use [`setup-tidbcloud-cli`](https://github.com/tidbcloud/setup-tidbcloud-cli).

Install the MySQL command-line client if you do not have it. You can refer to the instructions in [MySQL Installer for Windows](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-installer.html) for the installation. To launch `ticloud connect` on Windows, you need to have the directory containing `mysql.exe` in the PATH environment variable.

## Quick start

[TiDB Serverless](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-serverless-beta) (Beta) is the best way to get started with TiDB Cloud. In this section, you will learn how to create a TiDB Serverless cluster with TiDB Cloud CLI.

### Create a user profile

Before creating a cluster, you need to create a user profile with your TiDB Cloud API Key:

```shell
ticloud config create
```

> **Warning:**
>
> The profile name **MUST NOT** contain `.`.

### Create a TiDB Serverless cluster

To create a TiDB Serverless cluster, enter the following command, and then follow the CLI prompts to provide the required information and set the password:

```shell
ticloud cluster create
```

### Connect to the cluster

After the cluster is created, you can connect to the cluster:

```shell
ticloud cluster connect
```

When you are prompted about whether to use the default user, choose `Y` and enter the password that you set when creating the cluster.
