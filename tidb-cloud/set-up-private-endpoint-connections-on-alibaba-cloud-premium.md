# Connect to Premium via Alibaba Cloud Private Endpoint

This tutorial walks you through the steps to connect to your Premium instance via a private endpoint on Alibaba Cloud. Connecting through a private endpoint allows secure and private communication between your services and your TiDB Cloud instance without using the public internet.

> **Tip:**
>
> To learn how to connect to a TiDB Premium instance via AWS PrivateLink, see [Connect to TiDB Cloud via AWS PrivateLink](/tidb-cloud/premium/connect-via-private-connection-premium.md).

## Restrictions

- Currently, TiDB Premium supports private endpoint connections when the endpoint service is hosted on AWS or Alibaba Cloud. If the service is hosted on another cloud provider, the private endpoint is not applicable.
- Private endpoint connection across regions is not supported.

## Set up a private endpoint with Alibaba Cloud

To connect to your Premium instance via a private endpoint, follow these steps:

1. [Choose a TiDB instance](#step-1-choose-a-tidb-instance)
2. [Create a private endpoint on Alibaba Cloud](#step-2-create-a-private-endpoint-on-alibaba-cloud)
3. [Connect to your TiDB instance using the private endpoint](#step-3-connect-to-your-tidb-instance-using-the-private-endpoint)

### Step 1. Choose a TiDB instance

1. On the [**Instance**](https://{{{.console-url}}}/instances) page, click the name of your target TiDB Cloud instance to go to its overview page.
2. Click **Connect** in the upper-right corner. A connection dialog is displayed.
3. In the **Connection Type** drop-down list, select **Private Endpoint**.
4. Take a note of **Service Name**, **Availability Zone ID**, and **Region ID**.

### Step 2. Create a private endpoint on Alibaba Cloud

To use the Alibaba Cloud Management Console to create a VPC interface endpoint, perform the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Alibaba Cloud Management Console](https://account.alibabacloud.com/login/login.htm).
2. Navigate to **VPC** > **Endpoints**.
3. Click the **Interface Endpoints** tab, then click **Create Endpoint**.
4. Fill in the endpoint details:
    - **Region**: select the same region as your TiDB Cloud instance.
    - **Endpoint Name**: enter a name for the endpoint.
    - **Endpoint Type**: choose **Interface Endpoint**.
    - **Endpoint Service**: select **Other Endpoint Services**.
5. Paste the **Endpoint Service Name** you copied from TiDB Cloud.
6. Click **Verify**. A green check mark indicates that the service is valid.
7. Choose the **VPC**, **Security Group**, and **Zone** to associated with the endpoint.
8. Click **OK** to create the endpoint.
9. Wait until the endpoint status is **Active** and the connection status is **Connected**.

After creating the interface endpoint, navigate to the **EndPoints** page and select the newly created endpoint.

- In the **Basic Information** section, copy the **Endpoint ID**, this value will be used later as the *Endpoint Resource ID*.

- In the **Domain name of Endpoint Service** section, copy the **Default Domain Name**, this value will be used later as the *Domain Name*.

### Step 3. Accept the endpoint and create the endpoint connection

1. Return to the **Create Alibaba Cloud Private Endpoint Connection** dialog in the TiDB Cloud console.

2. Paste the previously copied *Endpoint Resource ID* and *Domain Name* into the corresponding fields.

3. Click **Create Private Endpoint Connection** to accept the connection from your private endpoint.

### Step 4. Connect to your TiDB instance

After you have accepted the endpoint connection, you are redirected back to the connection dialog.

1. Wait for the private endpoint connection status to become **Active** (approximately 5 minutes). To check the status, navigate to the **Networking** page by clicking **Settings** > **Networking** in the left navigation pane.

2. In the **Connect With** drop-down list, select your preferred connection method. The corresponding connection string is displayed at the bottom of the dialog.

3. Connect to your instance with the connection string.



## Private endpoint status reference

The possible statuses of a private endpoint are explained as follows:

- **Pending**: waiting for processing.
- **Active**: your private endpoint is ready to use.
