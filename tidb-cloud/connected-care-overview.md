# Connected Care Overview

As customers of all sizes continue to scale use cases and operations on TiDB Cloud, TiDB Cloud is committed to re-imagining its support services to accommodate their evolving needs. To deliver even greater value and seamless experiences, TiDB Cloud is excited to announce the launch of the new support services, **Connected Care**, on **Feb 17, 2025**.

As part of this transition, the current support plan offerings are no longer available for purchase and are classified as legacy support plans starting from **Feb 17, 2025**. However, TiDB Cloud continues to provide full support to customers subscribing to legacy plans until their respective [retirement dates](#transition-to-connected-care).

To ensure a smooth transition and access to the latest features, TiDB Cloud encourages customers to transition and adopt the Connected Care services.

## Connected Care

The Connected Care services are designed to strengthen your connection with TiDB Cloud through modern communication tools, proactive support, and advanced AI capabilities, delivering a seamless and customer-centric experience.

In the Connected Care services, there are four support plans: **Basic**, **Developer** (corresponding to the legacy **Standard** plan), **Enterprise**, and **Premium**.

> **Note**
>
> Although **Basic**, **Enterprise**, and **Premium** support plans use the same plan names as those in legacy plans, they refer to different plans with different service commitments.

The following table provides an overview for each support plan in the Connected Care services. For more information, see [Connected Care Details](/tidb-cloud/connected-care-detail.md).

- New **Basic** plan: customers will be guided to join the active community channels, where they can engage with other community members and interact with [TiDB.AI](https://tidb.ai/) for technical assistance.

## Transition to Connected Care

The following table lists the shutdown schedules for the legacy support plans:

| Support plans                        | Shutdown date |
|:----------------------------------------|:--------------|
| Legacy **Basic** plan                     | Feb 17, 2025  |
| Legacy **Standard** plan                           | Feb 17, 2025  |
| Legacy **Enterprise** and **Premium** plans | Jan 15, 2026  |

Once a legacy support plan shuts down, TiDB Cloud will no longer support it. If you do not transition to any support plan in Connected Care by the relevant shutdown date, you will be automatically transitioned to the **Basic** support plan in Connected Care.

## FAQs

### How do I check or make changes to my current support plan?

Visit the [Support](https://tidbcloud.com/console/org-settings/support) page in the TiDB Cloud console. Your current support plan is displayed in the upper-left area of the page.

Starting from Feb 17, 2025, you can transition to the new support plans on the [Support](https://tidbcloud.com/console/org-settings/support) page, except for the **Premium** support plan. To upgrade to the **Premium** plan, please [contact sales](https://www.pingcap.com/contact-us).

### Do I need to pay more for similar services?

While the new Connected Care services offer a more comprehensive and feature-rich support experience, the pricing remains closely aligned to the previous offerings. TiDB Cloud remains dedicated to delivering added value to better support your journey.

### How can I get technical support after the legacy **Basic** plan shuts down?

You can still access [billing and account support](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-support.md#create-an-account-or-billing-support-ticket). For technical support, consider purchasing a support plan in the Connected Care services. It is recommended that you start with the **Developer** plan, which includes a one-month free trial.
