# Recovery Group Billing

TiDB Cloud bills for Recovery Groups based on the deployed size of the TiKV cluster that is the primary cluster in the Recovery Group. When you [create a recovery group](/tidb-cloud/changefeed-overview.md#create-a-changefeed) for a cluster, you can select the primary cluster that the recovery group will be associated with. The larger the TiKV configuration, the higher the cost for Recovery Group protection.

## Price
