# Recovery Group Billing

TiDB Cloud bills for recovery groups based on the deployed size of the TiKV cluster that is the primary cluster in the recovery group. When you [create a recovery group](/tidb-cloud/recovery-group-get-started.md) for a cluster, you can select the primary cluster that the recovery group will be associated with. The larger the TiKV configuration, the higher the cost for recovery group protection.

## Price

To learn about the supported regions and the price of TiDB Cloud for each recovery group, see [Recovery Group Cost](https://www.pingcap.com/tidb-cloud-pricing-details/#recovery-group-cost).
