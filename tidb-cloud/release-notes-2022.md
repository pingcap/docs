# TiDB Cloud Release Notes in 2022

This page lists the release notes of [TiDB Cloud](https://www.pingcap.com/tidb-cloud/) in 2022.

## December 28, 2022

**General changes**

- Currently, after upgrading the default TiDB version of all [Serverless Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-serverless) clusters from [v6.3.0](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.3/release-6.3.0) to [v6.4.0](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.4/release-6.4.0), the cold start becomes slower in certain circumstances. So we roll back the default TiDB version of all Serverless Tier clusters from v6.4.0 to v6.3.0, then fix the problem as soon as possible, and upgrade it later again.

## December 27, 2022

**General changes**

- Upgrade the default TiDB version of all [Serverless Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-serverless) clusters from [v6.3.0](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.3/release-6.3.0) to [v6.4.0](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.4/release-6.4.0).

- The point-in-time recovery (PITR) for Dedicated Tier clusters is now in General Availability (GA).

    PITR supports restoring data of any point in time to a new cluster. To use the PITR feature, make sure that your TiDB cluster version is at least v6.4.0 and the TiKV node size is at least 8 vCPU and 16 GiB.

    You can enable or disable the PITR feature in the **Backup Settings** of the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com).

    For more information, see [Back up and restore TiDB cluster data](/tidb-cloud/backup-and-restore.md).

- Support managing multiple changefeeds and editing existing changefeeds.

    - You can now create as many changefeeds as needed to manage different data replication tasks. Currently, each cluster can have up to 10 changefeeds. For more details, refer to [Changefeed overview](/tidb-cloud/changefeed-overview.md).
    - You can edit the configuration of an existing changefeed in the paused status. For more information, see [Edit a changefeed](/tidb-cloud/changefeed-overview.md#edit-a-changefeed).

- Support directly migrating data from Amazon Aurora MySQL, Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) MySQL, or self-hosted MySQL-compatible databases to TiDB Cloud online. This feature is now in General Availability.

    - Provide services in the following 6 regions:
        - AWS Oregon (us-west-2)
        - AWS N. Virginia (us-east-1)
        - AWS Mumbai (ap-south-1)
        - AWS Singapore (ap-southeast-1)
        - AWS Tokyo (ap-northeast-1)
        - AWS Frankfurt (eu-central-1)
    - Support multiple specifications. You can choose an appropriate specification according to the required performance to achieve optimal data migration experience.

  For how to migrate data to TiDB Cloud, refer to [user documentation](/tidb-cloud/migrate-from-mysql-using-data-migration.md). For billing details, refer to [Data Migration billing](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-billing-dm.md).

- Support importing local CSV files to TiDB Cloud.

    It only takes a few clicks to complete the task configuration, and then your local CSV data can be quickly imported into your TiDB cluster. When using this method, you do not need to provide the cloud storage bucket path and Role ARN. The whole importing process is quick and smooth.

    For more information, see [Import local files to TiDB Cloud](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-import-local-files.md).

## December 20, 2022

**General changes**

- Add the label `project name` to the [Datadog](/tidb-cloud/monitor-datadog-integration.md) Dashboard as a filter to provide project information.

    You can use the filter `project name` to quickly find the cluster you want.

## December 13, 2022

**General changes**

- Introduce TiDB Cloud SQL Editor (Beta) for Serverless Tier.

    This is a web-based SQL editor that allows you to directly edit and run SQL queries against databases of Serverless Tier. You can locate it easily in the left navigation bar of your Serverless Tier cluster.

    For Serverless Tier, the Web SQL Shell is replaced by the SQL Editor.

- Support using [Changefeeds](/tidb-cloud/changefeed-overview.md) to stream data for Dedicated Tier.

    - Support [streaming data change logs to MySQL](/tidb-cloud/changefeed-sink-to-mysql.md).

      When data is migrated from MySQL/Aurora to TiDB, it is often necessary to use MySQL as a stand-by database to prevent unexpected data migration problems. In this case, you can use MySQL sink to stream data from TiDB to MySQL.

    - Support [streaming data change logs to Apache Kafka](/tidb-cloud/changefeed-sink-to-apache-kafka.md) (Beta).

      Streaming TiDB data to the message queue is a very common requirement for data integration scenarios. You can use Kafka sink to realize integration with other data processing systems (such as Snowflake), or support business consuming.

    For more information, refer to [Changefeed Overview](/tidb-cloud/changefeed-overview.md).

- Organization owners can edit the organization's name in **Organization Settings**.

**Console changes**

- Optimize the navigation layout of the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com) to provide users with a new navigation experience.

    The new layout includes the following changes:

    - Introduce the left navigation bar to maximize screen usage efficiency.
    - Adopt a flatter navigation hierarchy.

- Improve the [**Connect**](/tidb-cloud/connect-to-tidb-cluster-serverless.md) experience for Serverless Tier users.

    Now developers can connect to SQL editor or with their preferred tools in just a few clicks without context switching.

## December 6, 2022

**General changes**

- Upgrade the default TiDB version of new [Dedicated Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-dedicated) clusters from [v6.1.2](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/release-6.1.2) to [v6.1.3](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/release-6.1.3).

## November 29, 2022

**General changes**

- Improve the user experience from AWS Marketplace and Google Cloud Marketplace.

    No matter whether you are new to TiDB Cloud or you already have a TiDB Cloud account, now you can link with your AWS or GCP billing account, which makes it easier to complete AWS or GCP Marketplace subscriptions.

    For how to make the link, see [Billing from AWS Marketplace or Google Cloud Marketplace](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-billing.md#billing-from-aws-marketplace-or-google-cloud-marketplace).

## November 22, 2022

**General changes**

* Support directly migrating data from Amazon Aurora MySQL, Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) MySQL, or self-hosted MySQL-compatible databases to TiDB Cloud online (beta).

    Previously, you needed to pause your business and import data offline, or use third-party tools to migrate data to TiDB Cloud, which was complicated. Now, with the **Data Migration** feature, you only need to perform operations on your TiDB Cloud console and securely migrate your data to TiDB Cloud with minimal downtime.

    In addition, Data Migration provides full and incremental data migration capabilities to migrate both existing data and ongoing changes from your data source to TiDB Cloud.

    Currently, the Data Migration feature is still **in beta**. It is available only for [Dedicated Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-dedicated) clusters and only in the AWS Oregon (us-west-2) and AWS Singapore (ap-southeast-1) regions. You can create one migration job for free for each organization. To create multiple migration jobs for an organization, you need to [file a ticket](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-support.md).

    For detailed information, see [Migrate MySQL-Compatible Databases to TiDB Cloud Using Data Migration](/tidb-cloud/migrate-from-mysql-using-data-migration.md).

## November 15, 2022

**General changes**

* Support point-in-time recovery (PITR) for [Dedicated Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-dedicated) clusters (beta).

    PITR supports restoring data of any point in time to a new cluster. You can use it to:

    * Reduce RPO in disaster recovery.
    * Resolve data write errors by restoring point-in-time that is before the error event.
    * Audit the historical data of the business.

  To use the PITR feature, make sure that your TiDB cluster version is at least v6.3.0 and the TiKV node size is at least 8 vCPU and 16 GiB.

  By default, backup data is stored in the same region where the cluster is created. In Japan, for TiDB clusters hosted on GCP with PITR enabled, you can choose to store backup data in one or two regions (Tokyo and/or Osaka). Restoring data from an alternative region provides a higher level of data safety and can tolerate region failures.

  For more information, see [Back Up and Restore TiDB Cluster Data](/tidb-cloud/backup-and-restore.md).

  This feature is still in beta and only available upon request:

    * Click **Help** in the lower-right corner of TiDB Cloud console.
    * In the dialog, fill in "Apply for PITR" in the **Description** field and click **Send**.

* The database audit logging feature is now GA.

    You can use database audit logging to record a history of user access details (such as any SQL statements executed) in logs and conduct a periodic analysis of the database audit logs, which helps keep your database secure.

    For more information, see [Database Audit Logging](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-auditing.md).

## November 8, 2022

**General changes**

* Improve the user feedback channel.

    Now you can request a demo or credits in **Support** > **Give Feedback** in the TiDB Cloud console. This can be helpful if you want to learn more about TiDB Cloud.

    After receiving your request, we will contact you to provide help as soon as possible.

## October 28, 2022

**General changes**

* Developer Tier is upgraded to [Serverless Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-serverless). Serverless Tier, a fully-managed, auto-scaling deployment of TiDB, is now available. It is still in beta and free to use.

    * A Serverless Tier cluster still contains fully functional HTAP ability as Dedicated Tier clusters.
    * Serverless Tier offers you faster cluster creation time and instantaneous cold start time. Compared with Developer Tier, the creation time reduces from minutes to seconds.
    * You do not need to worry about deployment topology. Serverless Tier will adjust automatically according to your requests.
    * Serverless Tier [enforces TLS connection to clusters for the sake of security](/tidb-cloud/secure-connections-to-serverless-clusters.md).
    * Existing Developer Tier clusters will be automatically migrated to Serverless Tier in the coming months. Your ability to use your cluster should not be affected, and you will not be charged for the use of your Serverless Tier cluster in beta.

  Get started [here](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-quickstart.md).

## October 25, 2022

**General changes**

- Support dynamically changing and persisting a subset of TiDB system variables (beta).

    You can use the standard SQL statement to set a new value for a supported system variable.

    ```sql
    SET [GLOBAL|SESSION] <variable>
    ```

    For example:

    ```sql
    SET GLOBAL tidb_committer_concurrency = 127;
    ```

    If a variable is set at the `GLOBAL` level, the variable will be applied to the cluster and persistent (keep effective even after you restart or reload the server). A variable at the `SESSION` level is not persistent and is only effective in the current session.

    **This feature is still in beta**, and only a limited number of variables are supported. It is not recommended to modify other [system variables](/system-variables.md) due to uncertainty of the side effects. See the following list for all supported variables based on TiDB v6.1:

    - [`require_secure_transport`](/system-variables.md#require_secure_transport-new-in-v610)
    - [`tidb_committer_concurrency`](/system-variables.md#tidb_committer_concurrency-new-in-v610)
    - [`tidb_enable_batch_dml`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_batch_dml)
    - [`tidb_enable_prepared_plan_cache`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_prepared_plan_cache-new-in-v610)
    - [`tidb_max_tiflash_threads`](/system-variables.md#tidb_max_tiflash_threads-new-in-v610)
    - [`tidb_mem_oom_action`](/system-variables.md#tidb_mem_oom_action-new-in-v610)
    - [`tidb_mem_quota_query`](/system-variables.md#tidb_mem_quota_query)
    - [`tidb_prepared_plan_cache_size`](/system-variables.md#tidb_prepared_plan_cache_size-new-in-v610)
    - [`tidb_query_log_max_len`](/system-variables.md#tidb_query_log_max_len)

- Upgrade the default TiDB version of new [Dedicated Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-dedicated) clusters from [v6.1.1](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/release-6.1.1) to [v6.1.2](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/release-6.1.2).

## July 26, 2022

* Support automatic hibernation and resuming for new [Developer Tier clusters](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-serverless).

    A Developer Tier cluster will not be deleted after 7 days of inactivity so you can still use it at any time until the one-year free trial ends. After 24 hours of inactivity, the Developer Tier cluster will hibernate automatically. To resume the cluster, either send a new connection to the cluster or click the **Resume** button in the TiDB Cloud console. The cluster will be resumed within 50 seconds and back to service automatically.

* Add a user name prefix limitation for new [Developer Tier clusters](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-serverless).

    Whenever you use or set a database user name, you must include the prefix for your cluster in the user name. For more information, see [User name prefix](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#user-name-prefix).

* Disable the backup and restore feature for [Developer Tier clusters](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-serverless).

    The backup and restore feature (including both automatic backup and manual backup) is disabled for Developer Tier clusters. You can still use [Dumpling](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/dumpling-overview) to export your data as a backup.

* Increase the storage size of a [Developer Tier](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-serverless) cluster from 500 MiB to 1 GiB.
* Add breadcrumbs to the TiDB Cloud console to improve the navigation experience.
* Support configuring multiple filter rules when you import data into TiDB Cloud.

## July 05, 2022

* The columnar storage [TiFlash](/tiflash/tiflash-overview.md) is now in General Availability (GA).

    - TiFlash makes TiDB essentially an Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP) database. Your application data is first stored in TiKV and then replicated to TiFlash via the Raft consensus algorithm. So it is real time replication from the row storage to the columnar storage.
    - For tables with TiFlash replicas, the TiDB optimizer automatically determines whether to use either TiKV or TiFlash replicas based on the cost estimation.

    To experience the benefits brought by TiFlash, see [TiDB Cloud HTAP Quick Start Guide](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-htap-quickstart.md).

* Support [increasing the storage size](/tidb-cloud/scale-tidb-cluster.md#change-storage) of TiKV and TiFlash for a Dedicated Tier cluster.
