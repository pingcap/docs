# TiDB Cloud Release Notes in 2022

This page lists the release notes of [TiDB Cloud](https://en.pingcap.com/tidb-cloud/) in 2022.

## July 12, 2022

* Add the **Validate** button to the **Data Import Task** page for Amazon S3, which helps you detect data access issues before the data import starts.
* Add **Billing Profile** under the **Payment Method** tab. By providing your tax registration number in **Billing Profile**, certain taxes might be exempted from your invoice.

## July 05, 2022

* The columnar storage TiFlash is now in General Availability (GA).

    - TiFlash makes TiDB essentially an Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP) database. Your application data is first stored in TiKV and then replicated to TiFlash via the Raft consensus algorithm. So it is real time replication from the row storage to the columnar storage.
    - For tables with TiFlash replicas, the TiDB optimizer automatically determines whether to use either TiKV or TiFlash replicas based on the cost estimation.

    To experience the benefits brought by TiFlash, see [TiDB Cloud HTAP Quick Start Guide](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-htap-quickstart.md).

* Support [increasing the storage size](/tidb-cloud/scale-tidb-cluster.md) of TiKV and TiFlash for a Dedicated Tier cluster.
* Support showing the memory information in the node size field.

## June 28, 2022

* Upgrade TiDB Cloud Dedicated Tier from [TiDB v5.4.1](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/release-5.4.1) to [TiDB v6.1.0](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/release-6.1.0).

## June 23, 2022

* Increase the maximum storage capacity of TiKV on TiDB Cloud.

    * 8 vCPU or 16 vCPU TiKV: support up to 4 TiB storage capacity.
    * 4 vCPU TiKV: support up to 2 TiB storage capacity.

## June 21, 2022

* Add the support of the GCP region `Taiwan` for Dedicated Tier cluster creation.
* Support [updating user profiles](/tidb-cloud/manage-user-access.md#manage-user-profiles) on the TiDB Cloud console, including first name, last time, company name, country, and phone number.
* Provide the connection strings for MySQL, MyCLI, JDBC, Python, Go, and Node.js on the TiDB Cloud console so you can easily connect to your TiDB cluster.
* Support obtaining bucket regions from bucket URLs automatically during data import to save your effort to fill in such information.

## June 16, 2022

* Simplify the cluster creation process.

    - When you create a cluster, TiDB Cloud provides a default cluster name. You can either use the default name or update it.
    - When you create a cluster, you do not need to set the password on the **Create a Cluster** page.
    - During or after the cluster creation, you can set the root password to access the cluster and also the IP addresses to connect to the cluster in the **Security Quick Start** dialog box.
