# Use TiDB Cloud Dedicated Private Endpoint Connection Resource

This document describes how to manage a [TiDB Cloud Dedicated](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-cloud-dedicated) private endpoint connection using the `tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection` resource.

The features of the `tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection` resource include the following:

- Create TiDB Cloud Dedicated private endpoint connections.
- Import TiDB Cloud Dedicated private endpoint connections.
- Delete TiDB Cloud Dedicated private endpoint connections.

> **Note:**
>
> TiDB Cloud Dedicated private endpoint connection resource cannot be modified. If you want to modify a TiDB Cloud Dedicated private endpoint connection, you need to delete the existing one, and then create a new one.

## Prerequisites

- [Get TiDB Cloud Terraform Provider](/tidb-cloud/terraform-get-tidbcloud-provider.md) v0.4.0 or later.
- [Create a TiDB Cloud Dedicated Cluster](/tidb-cloud/create-tidb-cluster.md).

## Create a TiDB Cloud Dedicated private endpoint connection

You can create a TiDB Cloud Dedicated private endpoint connection using the `tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection` resource.

The following example shows how to create a TiDB Cloud Dedicated private endpoint connection.

1. Create a directory for the TiDB Cloud Dedicated private endpoint connection and enter it.

2. Create a `private_endpoint_connection.tf` file:

    ```
    terraform {
      required_providers {
        tidbcloud = {
          source = "tidbcloud/tidbcloud"
        }
      }
    }

    provider "tidbcloud" {
      public_key = "your_public_key"
      private_key = "your_private_key"
    }

    resource "tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection" "example" {
      cluster_id = "your_cluster_id"
      node_group_id = "your_node_group_id"
      endpoint_id = "your_endpoint_id"
    }
    ```

    Use the `resource` block to define the resource of TiDB Cloud, including the resource type, resource name, and resource details.

    - To use the TiDB Cloud Dedicated private endpoint connection resource, set the resource type as `tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection`.
    - For the resource name, you can define it as needed. For example, `example`.
    - If you do not know how to get the values of the required arguments, see [Connect to a TiDB Cloud Dedicated Cluster via Private Endpoint with AWS](/tidb-cloud/set-up-private-endpoint-connections.md).
    - To get the TiDB Cloud Dedicated private endpoint connection specification information, see [tidbcloud_private_endpoint_connection (Resource)](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/tidbcloud/tidbcloud/latest/docs/resources/dedicated_private_endpoint_connection).

3. Run the `terraform apply` command. It is not recommended to use `terraform apply --auto-approve` when you apply a resource.

    ```shell
    $ terraform apply

    Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
      + create

    Terraform will perform the following actions:

        # tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection.example will be created
        + resource "tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection" "example" {
            + account_id                     = (known after apply)
            + cloud_provider                 = (known after apply)
            + cluster_display_name           = (known after apply)
            + cluster_id                     = "10757937805044000000"
            + endpoint_id                    = "vpce-03367e9618000000"
            + endpoint_state                 = (known after apply)
            + host                           = (known after apply)
            + labels                         = (known after apply)
            + message                        = (known after apply)
            + node_group_id                  = "1934178998036000000"
            + port                           = (known after apply)
            + private_endpoint_connection_id = (known after apply)
            + private_link_service_name      = (known after apply)
            + region_display_name            = (known after apply)
            + region_id                      = (known after apply)
        }

    Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

    Do you want to perform these actions?
        Terraform will perform the actions described above.
        Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

        Enter a value:
    ```

    In the preceding result, Terraform generates an execution plan for you, which describes the actions Terraform will take:

    - You can check the differences between the configurations and the states.
    - You can also see the results of this `apply`. It will add a new resource, and no resource will be changed or destroyed.
    - `known after apply` indicates that you will get the corresponding value after `apply`.

4. If everything in your plan looks fine, type `yes` to continue:

    ```shell
    Do you want to perform these actions?
      Terraform will perform the actions described above.
      Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

      Enter a value: yes

    tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection.example: Creating...
    tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection.example: Creation complete after 10s

    Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
    ```

5. Use the `terraform show` or `terraform state show tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection.${resource-name}` command to inspect the state of your resource. The former command shows the states of all resources and data sources.

    ```shell
    $ terraform state show tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection.example
    # tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection.example:
    resource "tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection" "example" {
        cloud_provider                 = "aws"
        cluster_display_name           = "test-tf"
        cluster_id                     = "10757937805044000000"
        endpoint_id                    = "vpce-03367e96180000000"
        endpoint_state                 = "ACTIVE"
        host                           = "privatelink-19341000.ubkypd000000.clusters.tidb-cloud.com"
        labels                         = {
            "tidb.cloud/project" = "1372813089454000000"
        }
        message                        = "The VPC Endpoint Id '{vpce-03367e961805e35b6 []}' does not exist"
        node_group_id                  = "1934178998036000000"
        port                           = 4000
        private_endpoint_connection_id = "1934214559409000000"
        private_link_service_name      = "com.amazonaws.vpce.us-west-2.vpce-svc-07468b31cc9000000"
        region_display_name            = "Oregon (us-west-2)"
        region_id                      = "aws-us-west-2"
    }
    ```

## Import a TiDB Cloud Dedicated private endpoint connection

For a TiDB Cloud Dedicated private endpoint connection that is not managed by Terraform, you can start managing it with Terraform by importing it.

1. Add an import block for the new TiDB Cloud Dedicated private endpoint connection resource.

    Add the following import block to your `.tf` file, replace `example` with a desired resource name, and replace `${id}` with the format of `cluster_id,dedicated_private_endpoint_connection_id`:

    ```
    import {
      to = tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection.example
      id = "${id}"
    }
    ```

2. Generate the new configuration file.

    Generate the new configuration file for the new TiDB Cloud Dedicated private endpoint connection resource according to the import block:

    ```shell
    terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated.tf
    ```

    Do not specify an existing `.tf` filename in the preceding command. Otherwise, Terraform will return an error.

    Then the `generated.tf` file is created in the current directory, which contains the configuration of the imported resource.

3. Review and apply the generated configuration.

    Review the generated configuration file to ensure that it meets your needs. Optionally, you can move the contents of this file to your preferred location.

    Then, run `terraform apply` to import your infrastructure. After applying, the example output is as follows: 

    ```shell
    tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection.example: Importing... [id=aws-1934187953894000000,example]
    tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection.example: Import complete [id=aws-19341879538940000000,example]

    Apply complete! Resources: 1 imported, 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
    ```

    Now you can manage the imported TiDB Cloud Dedicated private endpoint connection with Terraform.

## Delete a TiDB Cloud Dedicated private endpoint connection

To delete a TiDB Cloud Dedicated private endpoint connection, you can delete the configuration of the `tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection` resource, and then use the `terraform apply` command to destroy the resource:

```shell
  $ terraform apply
  tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection.example: Refreshing state...

  Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  - destroy

  Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection.example will be destroyed
  # (because tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection.example is not in configuration)
  - resource "tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection" "example" {
      - cloud_provider                 = "aws" -> null
      - cluster_display_name           = "test-tf" -> null
      - cluster_id                     = "10757937805044000000" -> null
      - endpoint_id                    = "vpce-03367e96180000000" -> null
      - endpoint_state                 = "ACTIVE" -> null
      - host                           = "privatelink-19341000.ubkypd1sx000.clusters.tidb-cloud.com" -> null
      - labels                         = {
          - "tidb.cloud/project" = "1372813089454000000"
          } -> null
      - message                        = "The VPC Endpoint Id '{vpce-03367e961805e35b6 []}' does not exist" -> null
      - node_group_id                  = "1934178998036000000" -> null
      - port                           = 4000 -> null
      - private_endpoint_connection_id = "1934214559409000000" -> null
      - private_link_service_name      = "com.amazonaws.vpce.us-west-2.vpce-svc-07468b31cc9000000" -> null
      - region_display_name            = "Oregon (us-west-2)" -> null
      - region_id                      = "aws-us-west-2" -> null
      }

  Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

  Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

  tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection.example: Destroying...
  tidbcloud_dedicated_private_endpoint_connection.example: Destruction complete after 1s

  Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 1 destroyed.
```

Now, if you run the `terraform show` command, you will get nothing because the resource has been cleared:

```
$ terraform show
```
