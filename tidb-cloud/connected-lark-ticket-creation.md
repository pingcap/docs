# Create Tickets and Subscribe to Ticket Updates via Lark

For customers subscribed to the **Enterprise** [support plan](/tidb-cloud/connected-care-detail.md), TiDB Cloud provides a ticket bot called **PingCAP Support Bot** in [Lark](https://www.larksuite.com/), to manage ticket creation and updates from the support ticket system.

> **Note:**
>
> The ticket support feature for Lark is available upon request. If you are interested in trying this feature, contact TiDB Cloud support at <a href="mailto:support@pingcap.com">support@pingcap.com</a> or reach out to your Technical Account Manager (TAM).

## Create a support ticket

In the PingCAP Support lark group, you only need to mention **PingCAP Support Bot** and describe the problem in a message. Then, the ticket bot will send you a ephemeral card message that is only visible to you.
