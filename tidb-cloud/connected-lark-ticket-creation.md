# Create Tickets and Subscribe to Ticket Updates via Lark

For customers subscribed to the **Enterprise** [support plan](/tidb-cloud/connected-care-detail.md), TiDB Cloud provides a ticket bot called **PingCAP Support Bot** in [Lark](https://www.larksuite.com/), to manage ticket creation and updates from the support ticket system.

> **Note:**
>
> The ticket support feature for Lark is still in beta and is available upon request. If you are interested in trying this feature, contact TiDB Cloud support <support@pingcap.com> or reach out to your Technical Account Manager (TAM).

## Create a support ticket

In the **Customer Support Group** Lark group, type `@PingCAP Support Bot create ticket` in a message. Then, **PingCAP Support Bot** will reply with a Lark message card for ticket creation.

Fill in the required fields and click **Submit**. Once submitted, the card will be updated to **Ticket Submitted**, indicating that your request is being processed.

After the support ticket is created, the **Ticket Submitted** card will be updated to the **Support Ticket Created** card, providing the ticket name and a link to view the ticket.

Whenever a PingCAP support engineer comments on the ticket, **PingCAP Support Bot** will send a **New Comment on Your Ticket** card to the Lark group.
