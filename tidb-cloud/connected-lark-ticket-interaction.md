# Interact with Support Tickets via Lark

For customers subscribed to the **Premium** [support plan](/tidb-cloud/connected-care-detail.md), TiDB Cloud provides a ticket bot called **PingCAP Support Bot** in [Lark](https://www.larksuite.com/), to support more comprehensive interaction and management of support tickets.

> **Note:**
>
> The ticket support feature for Lark is available upon request. If you are interested in trying this feature, contact TiDB Cloud support at <a href="mailto:support@pingcap.com">support@pingcap.com</a> or reach out to your Technical Account Manager (TAM).

## Interact with support tickets

In the PingCAP Support Lark group, you only need to mention **PingCAP Support Bot** and describe the problem in a message. Then, the bot will send you an ephemeral card message that is only visible to you.

Fill in the card according to your actual problem, and then click **Submit** to submit the ticket. Please note that the "Reporter" field should be the email address you use in the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com/).

After successfully creating the ticket, the bot will reply with the ticket link in the thread.

Customers subscribed to the **Premium** [support plan](/tidb-cloud/connected-care-detail.md) can use two-way information synchronization between Lark and the ticket system.

When a support engineer responds to the ticket, the response will be synchronized to the Lark message thread, so you do not need to visit the support portal to view them. You can reply directly in the same message thread, and your replies will also be synchronized to the ticket system.

With this capability, customers subscribed to the **Premium** support plan can quickly create, respond to, and manage tickets without leaving Lark.
