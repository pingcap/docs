# Interact with Support Tickets via Lark

For customers subscribed to the **Premium** [support plan](/tidb-cloud/connected-care-detail.md), TiDB Cloud provides a ticket bot called **PingCAP Support Bot** in [Lark](https://www.larksuite.com/), to support more comprehensive interaction and management of support tickets.

> **Note:**
>
> The ticket support feature for Lark is available upon request. If you are interested in trying this feature, contact TiDB Cloud support at <a href="mailto:support@pingcap.com">support@pingcap.com</a> or reach out to your Technical Account Manager (TAM).

## Interact with support tickets

If Interaction for Support Tickets is enabled, **PingCAP Support Bot** will convert the **Support Ticket Created** message card to a thread to manage ticket interactions.

When a PingCAP support engineer comments on the ticket, the comment will be automatically synchronized to the thread.

When anyone comments in the thread, the comment will be synchronized back to the corresponding support ticket.

## FAQs

- How can I check the status of my ticket?

    Log in to the [PingCAP Help Center](https://tidb.support.pingcap.com/servicedesk/customer/user/requests) with the email address used to create the ticket. You can view all historical tickets and their status for the current account.
