# Interact with Support Tickets via Lark

For customers subscribed to the **Premium** [support plan](/tidb-cloud/connected-care-detail.md), TiDB Cloud provides a ticket bot called **PingCAP Support Bot** in [Lark](https://www.larksuite.com/), to support more comprehensive interaction and management of support tickets.

> **Note:**
>
> The ticket support feature for Lark is available upon request. If you are interested in trying this feature, contact TiDB Cloud support at <a href="mailto:support@pingcap.com">support@pingcap.com</a> or reach out to your Technical Account Manager (TAM).

## Interact with support tickets

In the Lark support group, you only need to mention **PingCAP Support Bot** and describe the problem in a message. Then, the ticket bot will send you a ephemeral card message that is only visible to you.

Fill in the card according to your actual problem, and then click **Submit** to submit the ticket.

After successfully creating the ticket, the bot will reply with the ticket link in the thread.

For customers subscribed to the **Premium** [support plan](/tidb-cloud/connected-care-detail.md), two-way information synchronization is supported between Lark and the ticket system.

The support engineer's comments on the ticket will be synchronized to the lark message thread, and users do not need to jump to the support portal to view them. Users can reply directly in this message thread, and these replies will be synchronized to the ticket system.

In this way, customers subscribed to the **Premium** support plan can quickly create, respond, and manage tickets without leaving Lark.
