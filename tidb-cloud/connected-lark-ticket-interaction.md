# Interact with Support Tickets via Lark

For customers subscribed to the **Premium** [support plan](/tidb-cloud/connected-care-detail.md), TiDB Cloud provides a ticket bot called **PingCAP Support Bot** in [Lark](https://www.larksuite.com/), to support more comprehensive interaction and management of support tickets.

> **Note:**
>
> The ticket support feature for Lark is available upon request. If you are interested in trying this feature, contact TiDB Cloud support at <a href="mailto:support@pingcap.com">support@pingcap.com</a> or reach out to your Technical Account Manager (TAM).

## Interact with support tickets

After you [create a support ticket](/tidb-cloud/connected-lark-ticket-creation.md#create-a-support-ticket) in the **PingCAP Support Group** on Lark, the bot replies with the ticket link in the message thread.

If you subscribe to the **Premium** [support plan](/tidb-cloud/connected-care-detail.md), you can use two-way information synchronization between Lark and the ticket system.

When a support engineer responds to your ticket, the response is synchronized to the Lark message thread. You can view the response and reply directly in the thread without visiting the support portal. Your replies are also synchronized to the ticket system.

With this capability, if you subscribe to the **Premium** support plan, you can quickly create, respond to, and manage tickets without leaving Lark.
