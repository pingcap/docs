# Monitoring

Monitoring in TiDB Cloud provides tools and integrations that enable you to oversee cluster performance, track activity, and respond to issues in a timely manner.

## Built-in metrics

Built-in metrics refer to a full set of standard metrics of your cluster that TiDB Cloud collects and presents on the Metrics page. With these metrics, you can easily identify performance issues and determine whether your current database deployment meets your requirements.

For more information, see [TiDB Cloud Built-in Metrics](/tidb-cloud/built-in-monitoring.md).

## Cluster events

In TiDB Cloud, an event indicates a change in your TiDB Cloud cluster. TiDB Cloud logs the historical events at the cluster level to help you track cluster activities. You can view the logged events on the **Events** page, including the event type, status, message, trigger time, and trigger user.

For more information, see [TiDB Cloud Cluster Event](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-events.md).
