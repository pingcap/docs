# Configure Maintenance Window

A maintenance window is a designated timeframe during which scheduled maintenance activities, such as operating system updates, security patches, and infrastructure upgrades, are executed to ensure the reliability, security, and performance of the TiDB Cloud service.

With the maintenance window feature, you can easily schedule and manage maintenance tasks, minimizing the impact on cluster availability.

> **Note:**
>
> - The maintenance window feature is only available for [Dedicated Tier clusters](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#dedicated-tier) under the specified project (as multiple clusters are hosted in one EKS).
> - When the schedule maintenance time comes, if a manual or daily backup is currently in progress, the maintenance might be delayed until the backup is successfully completed.

During the maintenance window, you might experience temporary connection disruptions or QPS fluctuations, but the clusters remain accessible.

- The existing data import, backup, restore, migration, and replication tasks can still run normally.
- Maintenance tasks are executed on each eligible TiDB cluster one by one so the overall impact on the cluster performance is minimal.

## Allowed and disallowed operations during a maintenance window

- The following operations are allowed during a maintenance window:

    - DDL operations
    - Create clusters
    - Delete clusters
    - Create backup tasks
    - Restore clusters
    - Access the cluster **Overview**, **Events**, **Backup** pages

- The following operations are disallowed during a maintenance window (the corresponding features will be displayed in gray in the TiDB Cloud console):

    - Modify, pause, or resume clusters
    - Change security settings
    - Create private links or configure VPC peering
    - Create import tasks, migration jobs, or changefeeds
    - Access the cluster **SQL Diagnosis**,**Monitoring**, and **Alerts** pages

## Be notified by maintenance windows

It is important to be aware of the maintenance window schedule and plan your operations accordingly to avoid potential disruptions.

For each maintenance window, all project members will receive three emails as notifications from TiDB Cloud at the following time points:

- 72 hours before the maintenance window starts.
- The time when the maintenance tasks are started.
- The time when the maintenance tasks are completed.

## View and configure maintenance windows

Scheduling regular maintenance ensures that essential updates are performed and safeguards the TiDB Cloud service from security threats, performance issues, and unreliability. Therefore, the maintenance window is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.

The default maintenance window starts at 03:00 AM every Wednesday (based on the project time zone of your cluster). You can modify the start time of the maintenance window, or defer maintenance items until the deadline as follows:

1. In the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com/), navigate to the [Clusters](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page of your project.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > If you have multiple projects, you can view the project list and switch to another project from the â˜° hover menu in the upper-left corner.

     If a maintenance window is planned, the corresponding maintenance items are displayed on the **Maintenance** page 2 to 4 weeks before the deadline. For each maintenance item, you can view its descriptions, status, scheduled start time, and deadline, which is the latest time for execution.

5. If any scheduled maintenance items are displayed, the maintenance tasks will start at the designated time.

6. To defer the start time of a maintenance item, click **Defer** and set a new time.

    If deferring maintenance items beyond the deadline is required, you need to contact [TiDB Cloud support](/tidb-cloud/tidb-cloud-support.md#tidb-cloud-support) to get help.

## FAQs

- What is the frequency of triggering maintenance?

    It is infrequently, usually once every few months. And the maintenance items will be displayed 2 to 4 weeks before the deadline, allowing you to make necessary preparations.

- Are the clusters still be available during the maintenance window?

    TiDB clusters remain available during the maintenance window, and you can continue to perform SQL operations. You might experience brief connection disruptions or QPS fluctuations, which will be resolved after the maintenance is completed. Overall, the impact on the cluster is minimal.

- How can I enable and disable the maintenance window?

    The maintenance window is enabled by default and cannot be disabled. You can modify the start time of the maintenance window or defer maintenance items as described in [View and configure maintenance windows](#view-and-configure-maintenance-windows).

- How long does a maintenance window last?

    For each project, the maintenance is executed on each eligible TiDB cluster one by one. The duration of maintenance varies depending on the number of clusters, cluster data size, and the maintenance items to be performed.

- Will maintenance be performed on clusters in any state?

    No. If clusters are in states such as **IMPORTING**, **MODIFYING**, **BACKUP**, **RESTORING**, or **RESUMING**, maintenance tasks will be triggered after these operations are completed. For clusters in the **CREATING** state, maintenance operations are not required.

    Note that for clusters with large data volumes, the backup process might take a long time, such as 12 hours. If the scheduled maintenance time comes and a backup task is in progress, the maintenance will be triggered after the backup is completed. Therefore, it is recommended to carefully set the start time for backups and the maintenance window to minimize the impact on the clusters
