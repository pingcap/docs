## Monitoring metrics

In TiDB Cloud, you can view the commonly used metrics of a cluster from the following pages:

- **Metrics** page

### Overview page

The **Overview** page provides general metrics of a cluster.

To view metrics on the cluster overview page, take the following steps:

1. On the [**Clusters**](https://console.tidb.io/project/clusters) page, click the name of your target cluster to go to its overview page.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > You can use the combo box in the upper-left corner to switch between organizations, projects, and clusters.

2. Check the **Core Metrics** section.

### Metrics page

The **Metrics** page provides a full set of metrics of a cluster. By viewing these metrics, you can easily identify performance issues and determine whether your current database deployment meets your requirements.

To view metrics on the **Metrics** page, take the following steps:

1. On the [**Clusters**](https://console.tidb.io/project/clusters) page, click the name of your target cluster to go to its overview page.
