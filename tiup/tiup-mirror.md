# Create a Private Mirror

When creating a private cloud, usually, you need to use an isolated network environment, where the official mirror of TiUP is not accessible. Therefore, you can create a private mirror, which is mainly implemented by the `mirror` command. You can also use the `mirror` command for offline deployment. A private mirror also allows you to use components that you build and package by yourself.

## TiUP `mirror` overview

Execute the following command to get the help information of the `mirror` command:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```bash
tiup mirror --help
```

```bash
The `mirror` command is used to manage a component repository for TiUP, you can use
it to create a private repository, or to add new component to an existing repository.
The repository can be used either online or offline.
It also provides some useful utilities to help manage keys, users, and versions
of components or the repository itself.

Usage:
  tiup mirror <command> [flags]

Available Commands:
  init        Initialize an empty repository
  sign        Add signatures to a manifest file
  genkey      Generate a new key pair
  clone       Clone a local mirror from a remote mirror and download all selected components
  merge       Merge two or more offline mirrors
  publish     Publish a component
  show        Show the mirror address
  set         Set mirror address
  modify      Modify published component
  renew       Renew the manifest of a published component.
  grant       grant a new owner
  rotate      Rotate root.json

Global Flags:
      --help                 Help for this command

Use "tiup mirror [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Clone a mirror

You can run the `tiup mirror clone` command to build a local mirror:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```bash
tiup mirror clone <target-dir> [global-version] [flags]
```

- `target-dir`: used to specify the directory in which cloned data is stored.
- `global-version`: used to quickly set a global version for all components.

The `tiup mirror clone` command provides many optional flags (might provide more in the future). These flags can be divided into the following categories according to their intended usages:

- Determines whether to use prefix matching to match the version when cloning

    If the `--prefix` flag is specified, the version number is matched by prefix for the clone. For example, if you specify `--prefix` as "v5.0.0", then "v5.0.0-rc", and "v5.0.0" are matched.

- Determines whether to use the full clone

    If you specify the `--full` flag, you can clone the official mirror fully.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > If `--full`, `global-version` flags, and the component versions are not specified, only some meta information is cloned.

- Determines whether to clone packages from the specific platform

    If you want to clone packages only for a specific platform, use `-os` and `-arch` to specify the platform. For example:

    - Execute the `tiup mirror clone <target-dir> [global-version] --os=linux` command to clone for linux.
    - Execute the `tiup mirror clone <target-dir> [global-version] --arch=amd64` command to clone for amd64.
    - Execute the `tiup mirror clone <target-dir> [global-version] --os=linux --arch=amd64` command to clone for linux/amd64.

- Determines whether to clone a specific version of a package

    If you want to clone only one version (not all versions) of a component, use `--<component>=<version>` to specify this version. For example:

    - Execute the `tiup mirror clone <target-dir> --tidb v8.1.0` command to clone the v8.1.0 version of the TiDB component.
    - Run the `tiup mirror clone <target-dir> --tidb v8.1.0 --tikv all` command to clone the v8.1.0 version of the TiDB component and all versions of the TiKV component.
    - Run the `tiup mirror clone <target-dir> v8.1.0` command to clone the v8.1.0 version of all components in a cluster.

After cloning, signing keys are set up automatically.

### Manage the private repository

You can share the repository cloned using `tiup mirror clone` among hosts either by sharing files via SCP, NFS, or by making the repository available over the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. Use `tiup mirror set <location>` to specify the location of the repository.

```bash
tiup mirror set /shared_data/tiup
```

```bash
tiup mirror set https://tiup-mirror.example.com/
```

> **Note:**
>
> If you run `tiup mirror set...` on the machine where you run `tiup mirror clone`, the next time you run `tiup mirror clone...`, the machine clones from the local mirror, not the remote one. Therefore, you need to reset the mirror by running `tiup mirror set --reset` before updating the private mirror.

Another way of using a mirror is to use the `TIUP_MIRRORS` environment variable. Here is an example for running `tiup list` with a private repository.

```bash
export TIUP_MIRRORS=/shared_data/tiup
tiup list
```

`TIUP_MIRRORS` setting can permanently change the mirror configuration, for example, `tiup mirror set`. For details, see [tiup issue #651](https://github.com/pingcap/tiup/issues/651).

### Update the private repository

If you run the `tiup mirror clone` command again with the same `target-dir`, the machine will create new manifests and download the latest versions of components available.

> **Note:**
>
> Before recreating the manifest, ensure that all components and versions (including earlier ones downloaded previously) are included.

## Custom repository

You can create a custom repository to work with TiDB components like TiDB, TiKV, or PD that you build by yourself. It is also possible to create your own tiup components.

To create your own components, run the `tiup package` command and perform as instructed in [Component packaging](https://github.com/pingcap/tiup/blob/master/doc/user/package.md).

### Create a custom repository

To create an empty repository in `/data/mirror`:

```bash
tiup mirror init /data/mirror
```

As part of creating the repository, keys will be written to `/data/mirror/keys`.

To create a new private key in `~/.tiup/keys/private.json`:

```bash
tiup mirror genkey
```

Grant `jdoe` with private key `~/.tiup/keys/private.json` ownership of `/data/mirror`:

```bash
tiup mirror set /data/mirror
tiup mirror grant jdoe
```

### Work with custom components

1. Create a custom component called hello.

    ```bash
    $ cat > hello.c << END
    > #include <stdio.h>
    int main() {
      printf("hello\n");
      return (0);
    }
    END
    $ gcc hello.c -o hello
    $ tiup package hello --entry hello --name hello --release v0.0.1
    ```

    `package/hello-v0.0.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz` is created.

2. Create a repository and a private key, and grant ownership to the repository.

    ```bash
    $ tiup mirror init /tmp/m
    $ tiup mirror genkey
    $ tiup mirror set /tmp/m
    $ tiup mirror grant $USER
    ```

    ```bash
    tiup mirror publish hello v0.0.1 package/hello-v0.0.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz hello
    ```

3. Run the component. If it is not installed yet, it will be downloaded first.

    ```bash
    $ tiup hello
    ```

    ```
    The component `hello` version  is not installed; downloading from repository.
    Starting component `hello`: /home/dvaneeden/.tiup/components/hello/v0.0.1/hello
    hello
    ```

    With `tiup mirror merge`, you can merge a repository with custom components into another one. This assumes that all components in `/data/my_custom_components` are signed by the current `$USER`.

    ```bash
    $ tiup mirror set /data/my_mirror
    $ tiup mirror grant $USER
    $ tiup mirror merge /data/my_custom_components
    ```
