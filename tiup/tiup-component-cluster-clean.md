# tiup cluster clean

In the test environment, sometimes you might need to reset the cluster back to the state as it has been just deployed, which means to delete all data. You can do that easily using the `tiup cluster clean` command. After running it, the cluster is stopped and then cluster data is deleted. After restarting the cluster, you will get a clean cluster.

> **Warning:**
>
> This command will first stop the cluster even if you choose only to clean up logs. Therefore, do not use it in a production environment.
