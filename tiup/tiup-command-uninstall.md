# tiup uninstall

The `tiup uninstall` command is used to uninstall the installed components.

## Syntax

```sh
tiup uninstall <component1>:<version> [component2...N] [flags]
```

- `<component1>`: the name of a component to uninstall.
- `<version>`: the version to uninstall. If omitted, it uninstalls all installed versions of a component. For security reasons, the `--all` option must be added when `<version>` is omitted, indicating that all versions of a component need to be uninstalled.
- `[component2...N]`: multiple components or versions to uninstall.

## Options

### --all

- Uninstalls all installed versions of the specified components. You can use this option when `<version>` is omitted.
- Data type: `BOOLEAN`
- Default: `false`

### --self

- Uninstalls TiUP itself: delete all data downloaded from the mirror, but keep the data generated by TiUP and its components. The data is stored in the directory specified by the `TIUP_HOME` environment variable. If `TIUP_HOME` is not set, the default value is `~/.tiup/`.
- Data type: `BOOLEAN`
- Default: `false`

## Outputs

- If exits normally, output `Uninstalled component "%s" successfully!`.
- If neither `<version>` nor `--all` is specified, the `Use "tiup uninstall tidbx --all" if you want to remove all versions.` error is reported.
