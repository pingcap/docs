# Comment Syntax

TiDB supports three comment styles:

- Use `#` to comment a line.
- Use `--` to comment a line, and this style requires at least one whitespace after `--`.
- Use `/* */` to comment a block or multiple lines.

Example:

```sql
mysql> SELECT 1+1;     # This comment continues to the end of line
+------+
| 1+1  |
+------+
|    2 |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT 1+1;     -- This comment continues to the end of line
+------+
| 1+1  |
+------+
|    2 |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT 1 /* this is an in-line comment */ + 1;
+--------+
| 1  + 1 |
+--------+
|      2 |
+--------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> SELECT 1+
    -> /*
   /*> this is a
   /*> multiple-line comment
   /*> */
    -> 1;
+-------+
| 1+

1 |
+-------+
|     2 |
+-------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT 1+1--1;
+--------+
| 1+1--1 |
+--------+
|      3 |
+--------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```

Similar to MySQL, TiDB supports a variant of C comment style:

```
/*! Specific code */
```

The same as MySQL, TiDB runs the statements in the comment.

For example:

```sql
SELECT /*! STRAIGHT_JOIN */ col1 FROM table1,table2 WHERE ...
```

In TiDB, you can also use another version:

```sql
SELECT STRAIGHT_JOIN col1 FROM table1,table2 WHERE ...
```

If the server version number is specified in the comment, for example, `/*!50110 KEY_BLOCK_SIZE=1024 */`, in MySQL it means that the contents in this comment is processed only when the MySQL version is or higher than 5.1.10. But in TiDB, the MySQL version number does not work and all contents in the comment are processed. 

TiDB has its own comment syntax for the version numberï¼Œ which can be divided into the following two types:

* `/*T! Specific code */`: This syntax can only be parsed and executed by TiDB, and be ignored in other databases.
* `/*T![feature_id] Specific code */`: This syntax is used to ensure compatibility between different versions of TiDB. TiDB can parse the SQL fragment in this comment only if it implements the  corresponding feature of `feature_id` in the current version. For example, as the `AUTO_RANDOM` feature is introduced in v3.1.1, this version can parse `/*T![auto_rand] auto_random */` into `auto_random`. While the `AUTO_RANDOM` feature is not implemented in v3.0.0, the SQL statement fragment above is ignored.

Another type of comment is specially treated as the Hint optimizer:

```
SELECT /*+ hint */ FROM ...;
```

Since Hint is involved in comments like `/*+ xxx */`, the MySQL client clears the comment by default in versions earlier than 5.7.7. To use Hint in those earlier versions, add the `--comments` option when you start the client. For example:

```
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 4000 -uroot --comments
```
