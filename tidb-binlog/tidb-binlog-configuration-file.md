# TiDB Binlog Configuration File

This document introduces the configuration items of TiDB Binlog.

## Pump

This section introduces the configuration items of Pump. For the example of a complete Pump configuration file, see [Pump Configuration](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-binlog/blob/master/cmd/pump/pump.toml).

### addr

* Specifies the listening address of HTTP API in the format of `host:port`.
* Default value: `127.0.0.1:8250`

### advertise-addr

* Specifies the externally accessible HTTP API address. This address is registered in PD in the format of `host:port`.
* Default value: `127.0.0.1:8250`

### socket

* The Unix socket address that HTTP API listens to.
* Default value: ""

### pd-urls

* Specifies the comma-separated list of PD URLs. If multiple addresses are specified, when the PD client fails to connect to one address, it automatically tries to connect to another address.
* Default value: `http://127.0.0.1:2379`

### data-dir

* Specifies the directory where binlogs and their indexes are stored locally.
* Default value: `data.pump`

### heartbeat-interval

* Specifies the heartbeat interval (in seconds) at which the latest status is reported to PD.
* Default value: `2`

### gen-binlog-interval

* Specifies the interval (in seconds) at which data is written into fake binlog.
* Default value: `3`

### gc

* Specifies the number of days (integer) that binlogs can be stored locally. Binlogs stored longer than the specified number of days are automatically deleted.
* Default value: `7`

### log-file

* Specifies the path where log files are stored. If the parameter is set to an empty value, log files are not stored.
* Default value: ""

### log-level

* Specifies the log level.
* Default value: `info`

### node-id

* Specifies the Pump node ID. With this ID, this Pump process can be identified in the cluster.
* Default value: `hostname:port number`. For example, `node-1:8250`.

### security

This section introduces configuration items related to security.

#### ssl-ca

* Specifies the file path of the trusted SSL certificate list or CA list. For example, `/path/to/ca.pem`.
* Default value: ""

#### ssl-cert

* Specifies the path of the X509 certificate file encoded in the Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) format. For example, `/path/to/pump.pem`.
* Default value: ""

#### ssl-key

* Specifies the path of the X509 key file encoded in the PEM format. For example, `/path/to/pump-key.pem`.
* Default value: ""

### storage

This section introduces configuration items related to storage.

#### sync-log

* Specifies whether to use `fsync` after each **batch** write to binlog to ensure data safety.
* Default value: `true`

#### kv_chan_cap

* Specifies the number of write requests that the buffer can store before Pump receives these requests.
* Default value: `1048576` (that is, 2 to the power of 20)

#### slow_write_threshold

* The threshold (in seconds). If it takes longer to write a single binlog file than this specified threshold, the write is considered slow write and `"take a long time to write binlog"` is output in the log.
* Default value: `1`

#### stop-write-at-available-space

* Binlog write requests is no longer accepted when the available storage space is below this specified value. You can use the format such as `900 MB`, `5 GB`, and `12 GiB` to specify the storage space. If there is more than one Pump node in the cluster, when a Pump node refuses a write request because of the insufficient space, TiDB will automatically write binlogs to other Pump nodes.
* Default value: `10 GiB`

#### kv

Currently the storage of Pump is implemented based on [GoLevelDB](https://github.com/syndtr/goleveldb). Under `storage` there is also a `kv` subgroup that is used to adjust the GoLevel configuration. The supported configuration items are shown as below:

* block-cache-capacity
* block-restart-interval
* block-size
* compaction-L0-trigger
* compaction-table-size
* compaction-total-size
* compaction-total-size-multiplier
* write-buffer
* write-L0-pause-trigger
* write-L0-slowdown-trigger

For the detailed description of the above items, see [GoLevelDB Document](https://godoc.org/github.com/syndtr/goleveldb/leveldb/opt#Options).

## Drainer

This section introduces the configuration items of Drainer. For the example of a complete Drainer configuration file, see [Drainer Configuration](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-binlog/blob/master/cmd/drainer/drainer.toml)

### addr

* Specifies the listening address of HTTP API in the format of `host:port`.
* Default value: `127.0.0.1:8249`

### advertise-addr

* Specifies the externally accessible HTTP API address. This address is registered in PD in the format of `host:port`.
* Default value: `127.0.0.1:8249`

### log-file

* Specifies the path where log files are stored. If the parameter is set to an empty value, log files are not stored.
* Default value: ""

### log-level

* Specifies the log level.
* Default value: `info`

### node-id

* Specifies the Drainer node ID. With this ID, this Drainer process can be identified in the cluster.
* Default value: `hostname:port number`. For example, `node-1:8249`.

### data-dir

* Specifies the directory used to store files that need to be saved during Drainer operation.
* Default value: `data.drainer`

### detect-interval

* Specifies the interval (in seconds) at which PD updates the Pump information.
* Default value: `5`

### pd-urls

* The comma-separated list of PD URLs. If multiple addresses are specified, the PD client will automatically attempt to connect to another address if an error occurs when connecting to one address.
* Default value: `http://127.0.0.1:2379`

### initial-commit-ts

* Specifies from which commit timestamp the replication task starts. This configuration is only applicable to the Drainer node that starts replication for the first time. If a checkpoint already exists downstream, the replication will be performed according to the time recorded in the checkpoint.
* Default value: `-1`. Drainer will get a new timestamp from PD as the starting time.

### synced-check-time

* You can access the `/status` path through the HTTP API to query the status of Drainer replication. `synced-check-time` specifies how many minutes from the last successful replication is considered as `synced`, that is, the replication is complete.
* Default value: `5`

### compressor

* Specifies the compression algorithm used for data transfer between Pump and Drainer. Currently only the `gzip` algorithm is supported.
* Default value: "", which means no compression.

### security

This section introduces configuration items related to security.

#### ssl-ca

* Specifies the file path of the trusted SSL certificate list or CA list. For example, `/path/to/ca.pem`.
* Default value: ""

#### ssl-cert

* Specifies the path of the X509 certificate file encoded in the PEM format. For example, `/path/to/drainer.pem`.
* Default value: ""

#### ssl-key

* Specifies the path of the X509 key file encoded in the PEM format. For example, `/path/to/pump-key.pem`.
* Default value: ""

### syncer

The `syncer` section includes configuration items related to the downstream.

#### db-type

Currently, the following downstream types are supported:

* `mysql`
* `tidb`
* `kafka`
* `file`

Default value: `mysql`

#### sql-mode

* Specifies the SQL mode when the downstream is the `mysql` or `tidb` type. If there is more than one mode, use commas to separate them.
* Default value: ""

#### ignore-txn-commit-ts

* Specifies the commit timestamp at which the binlog is ignored.
* Default value: `[]`

#### ignore-schemas

* Specifies the database to be ignored during replication. If there is more than one database to be ignored, use commas to separate them. If all changes in a binlog file are filtered, the whole binlog file is ignored.
* Default value: `INFORMATION_SCHEMA,PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA,mysql`

#### ignore-table

Ignores the specified table changes during replication. You can specify multiple tables to be ignored in the `toml` file. For example:

{{< copyable "" >}}

```toml
[[syncer.ignore-table]]
db-name = "test"
tbl-name = "log"

[[syncer.ignore-table]]
db-name = "test"
tbl-name = "audit"
```

If all changes in a binlog file are filtered, the whole binlog file is ignored.

Default value: `[]`

#### replicate-do-db

* Specifies the database to be replicated. For example, `[db1, db2]`.
* Default value: `[]`

#### replicate-do-table

Specifies the table to be replicated. For example:

{{< copyable "" >}}

```toml
[[syncer.replicate-do-table]]
db-name ="test"
tbl-name = "log"

[[syncer.replicate-do-table]]
db-name ="test"
tbl-name = "~^a.*"
```

Default value: `[]`

#### txn-batch

* When the downstream is the `mysql` or `tidb` type, DML operations are executed in different batches. This parameter specifies how many DML operations can be included in each transaction.
* Default value: `20`

#### worker-count

* When the downstream is the `mysql` or `tidb` type, DML operations are executed concurrently. This parameter specifies the concurrency numbers of DML operations.
* Default value: `16`

#### disable-dispatch

* Disables the concurrency and forcibly set `worker-count` to `1`.
* Default value: `false`

#### safe-mode

If the safe mode is enabled, Drainer modifies the replication updates in the following way:

* `Insert` is modified to `Replace Into`
* `Update` is modified to `Delete` plus `Replace Into`

Default value: `false`

### syncer.to

The `syncer.to` section introduces different types of downstream configuration items according to configuration types.

#### mysql/tidb

The following configuration items are related to connection to downstream databases:

* `host`: If this item is not set, TiDB Binlog tries to check the `MYSQL_HOST` environment variable which is `localhost` by default.
* `port`: If this item is not set, TiDB Binlog tries to check the `MYSQL_PORT` environment variable which is `3306` by default.
* `user`: If this item is not set, TiDB Binlog tries to check the `MYSQL_USER` environment variable which is `root` by default.
* `password`: If this item is not set, TiDB Binlog tries to check the `MYSQL_PSWD` environment variable which is `""` by default.

#### file

* `dir`: Specifies the directory where binlog files are stored. If this item is not set, `data-dir` is used.

#### kafka

When the downstream is Kafka, the valid configuration items are as follows:

* `zookeeper-addrs`
* `kafka-addrs`
* `kafka-version`
* `kafka-max-messages`
* `topic-name`

### syncer.to.checkpoint

This section introduces a configuration item related to `syncer.to.checkpoint`.

### type

* Specifies in what way the replication progress is saved.
* Available options: `mysql` and `tidb`.

* Default value: The same as the downstream type. For example, when the downstream is `file`, the progress is saved in the local file system; when the downstream is `mysql`, the progress is saved in the downstream database. If you explicitly specify using `mysql` or `tidb` to store the progress, make the following configuration:

    * `schema`: `tidb_binlog` by default.

        > **Note:**
        >
        > When deploying multiple Drainer nodes in the same TiDB cluster, you need to specify a different checkpoint schema for each node. Otherwise, the replication progress of two instances will overwrite each other.

    * `host`
    * `user`
    * `password`
    * `port`
