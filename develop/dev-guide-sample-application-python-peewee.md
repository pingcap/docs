# Connect to TiDB with peewee

TiDB is a MySQL-compatible database, and [peewee](https://docs.peewee-orm.com/) is a popular Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for Python.

In this tutorial, you can learn how to use TiDB and peewee to accomplish the following tasks:

- Set up your environment.
- Connect to your TiDB cluster using peewee.
- Build and run your application. Optionally, you can find sample code snippets for basic CRUD operations.

> **Note:**
>
> This tutorial works with TiDB Serverless, TiDB Dedicated, and TiDB Self-Hosted clusters.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need:

- [Python 3.8 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- A TiDB cluster.

<CustomContent platform="tidb">

**If you don't have a TiDB cluster, you can create one as follows:**

- (Recommended) Follow [Creating a TiDB Serverless cluster](/develop/dev-guide-build-cluster-in-cloud.md) to create your own TiDB Cloud cluster.
- Follow [Deploy a local test TiDB cluster](/quick-start-with-tidb.md#deploy-a-local-test-cluster) or [Deploy a production TiDB cluster](/production-deployment-using-tiup.md) to create a local cluster.

## Run the sample app to connect to TiDB

This section demonstrates how to run the sample application code and connect to TiDB.

### Step 1: Clone the sample app repository

Run the following commands in your terminal window to clone the sample code repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tidb-samples/tidb-python-peewee-quickstart.git
cd tidb-python-peewee-quickstart
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

Run the following command to install the required packages (including peewee and PyMySQL) for the sample app:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Why use PyMySQL?

peewee is an ORM library that works with multiple databases. It provides a high-level abstraction of the database, which helps developers write SQL statements in a more object-oriented way. However, peewee does not include a database driver. To connect to a database, you need to install a database driver. This sample application uses PyMySQL as the database driver, which is a pure Python MySQL client library that is compatible with TiDB and can be installed on all platforms. For more information, refer to [peewee official documentation](https://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/database.html?highlight=mysql#using-mysql).

### Step 3: Configure connection information

Connect to your TiDB cluster depending on the TiDB deployment option you've selected.

<SimpleTab>
<div label="TiDB Serverless">

1. Navigate to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page, and then click the name of your target cluster to go to its overview page.

2. Click **Connect** in the upper-right corner. A connection dialog is displayed.

3. Ensure the configurations in the connection dialog match your operating environment.

    - **Endpoint Type** is set to `Public`
    - **Branch** is set to `main`
    - **Connect With** is set to `General`
    - **Operating System** matches your environment.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > If your program is running in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), switch to the corresponding Linux distribution.

4. Click **Generate Password** to create a random password.

    > **Tip:**
    > 
    > If you have created a password before, you can either use the original password or click **Reset Password** to generate a new one.

5. Run the following command to copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`:

    ```shell
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

6. Copy and paste the corresponding connection string into the `.env` file. The example result is as follows:

    ```dotenv
    TIDB_HOST='{host}'  # e.g. gateway01.ap-northeast-1.prod.aws.tidbcloud.com
    TIDB_PORT='4000'
    TIDB_USER='{user}'  # e.g. xxxxxx.root
    TIDB_PASSWORD='{password}'
    TIDB_DB_NAME='test'
    CA_PATH='{ssl_ca}'  # e.g. /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt (Debian / Ubuntu / Arch)
    ```

    Be sure to replace the placeholders `{}` with the connection parameters obtained from the connection dialog.

7. Save the `.env` file.

</div>
<div label="TiDB Dedicated">

1. Navigate to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page, and then click the name of your target cluster to go to its overview page.

2. Click **Connect** in the upper-right corner. A connection dialog is displayed.

3. Click **Allow Access from Anywhere** and then click **Download CA cert** to download the CA certificate.

    For more details about how to obtain the connection string, refer to [TiDB Dedicated standard connection](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/connect-via-standard-connection).

4. Run the following command to copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`:

    ```shell
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5. Copy and paste the corresponding connection string into the `.env` file. The example result is as follows:

    ```dotenv
    TIDB_HOST='{host}'  # e.g. tidb.xxxx.clusters.tidb-cloud.com
    TIDB_PORT='4000'
    TIDB_USER='{user}'  # e.g. root
    TIDB_PASSWORD='{password}'
    TIDB_DB_NAME='test'
    CA_PATH='{your-downloaded-ca-path}'
    ```

    Be sure to replace the placeholders `{}` with the connection parameters obtained from the connection dialog, and configure `CA_PATH` with the certificate path downloaded in the previous step.

6. Save the `.env` file.

</div>
<div label="TiDB Self-Hosted">

1. Run the following command to copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`:

    ```shell
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2. Copy and paste the corresponding connection string into the `.env` file. The example result is as follows:

    ```dotenv
    TIDB_HOST='{tidb_server_host}'
    TIDB_PORT='4000'
    TIDB_USER='root'
    TIDB_PASSWORD='{password}'
    TIDB_DB_NAME='test'
    ```

    Be sure to replace the placeholders `{}` with the connection parameters, and remove the `CA_PATH` line. If you are running TiDB locally, the default host address is `127.0.0.1`, and the password is empty.

3. Save the `.env` file.

</div>
</SimpleTab>

### Step 4: Run the code and check the result

1. Execute the following command to run the sample code:

    ```shell
    python peewee_example.py
    ```

2. Check the [Expected-Output.txt](https://github.com/tidb-samples/tidb-python-peewee-quickstart/blob/main/Expected-Output.txt) to see if the output matches.

## Sample code snippets

You can refer to the following sample code snippets to complete your own application development.

For complete sample code and how to run it, check out the [tidb-samples/tidb-python-peewee-quickstart](https://github.com/tidb-samples/tidb-python-peewee-quickstart) repository.

### Connect to TiDB

```python
from peewee import MySQLDatabase

def get_db_engine():
    config = Config()
    connect_params = {}
    if ${ca_path}:
        connect_params = {
            "ssl_verify_cert": True,
            "ssl_verify_identity": True,
            "ssl_ca": ${ca_path},
        }
    return MySQLDatabase(
        ${tidb_db_name},
        host=${tidb_host},
        port=${tidb_port},
        user=${tidb_user},
        password=${tidb_password},
        **connect_params,
    )
```

When using this function, you need to replace `${tidb_host}`, `${tidb_port}`, `${tidb_user}`, `${tidb_password}`, `${tidb_db_name}` and `${ca_path}` with the actual values of your TiDB cluster.

### Define a table

```python
from peewee import Model, CharField, IntegerField

db = get_db_engine()

class BaseModel(Model):
    class Meta:
        database = db

class Player(BaseModel):
    name = CharField(max_length=32, unique=True)
    coins = IntegerField(default=0)
    goods = IntegerField(default=0)

    class Meta:
        table_name = "players"
```

For more information, refer to [peewee documentation: Models and Fields](https://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/models.html).

### Insert data

```python
# Insert a single record
Player.create(name="test", coins=100, goods=100)

# Insert multiple records
Player.insert_many(
    [
        {"name": "test1", "coins": 100, "goods": 100},
        {"name": "test2", "coins": 100, "goods": 100},
    ]
).execute()
```

For more information, refer to [Insert data](/develop/dev-guide-insert-data.md).

### Query data

```python
# Query all records
players = Player.select()

# Query a single record
player = Player.get(Player.name == "test")

# Query multiple records
players = Player.select().where(Player.coins == 100)
```

For more information, refer to [Query data](/develop/dev-guide-get-data-from-single-table.md).

### Update data

```python
# Update a single record
player = Player.get(Player.name == "test")
player.coins = 200
player.save()

# Update multiple records
Player.update(coins=200).where(Player.coins == 100).execute()
```

For more information, refer to [Update data](/develop/dev-guide-update-data.md).

### Delete data

```python
# Delete a single record
player = Player.get(Player.name == "test")
player.delete_instance()

# Delete multiple records
Player.delete().where(Player.coins == 100).execute()
```

For more information, refer to [Delete data](/develop/dev-guide-delete-data.md).
