# Build a Simple CRUD App with TiDB and SQLAlchemy

[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is a popular open-source ORM library for Python.

This document describes how to use TiDB and SQLAlchemy to build a simple CRUD application.

> **Note:**
>
> It is recommended to use Python 3.10 or a later Python version.

## Step 1. Launch your TiDB cluster

<CustomContent platform="tidb">

The following introduces how to start a TiDB cluster.

**Use a TiDB Serverless cluster**

For detailed steps, see [Create a TiDB Serverless cluster](/develop/dev-guide-build-cluster-in-cloud.md#step-1-create-a-tidb-serverless-cluster).

**Use a local cluster**

For detailed steps, see [Deploy a local test cluster](/quick-start-with-tidb.md#deploy-a-local-test-cluster) or [Deploy a TiDB cluster using TiUP](/production-deployment-using-tiup.md).

## Step 2. Get the code

```shell
git clone https://github.com/pingcap-inc/tidb-example-python.git
```

The following uses SQLAlchemy 1.44 as an example.

```python
import uuid
from typing import List

from sqlalchemy import create_engine, String, Column, Integer, select, func
from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base, sessionmaker

engine = create_engine('mysql://root:@127.0.0.1:4000/test')
Base = declarative_base()
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)


class Player(Base):
    __tablename__ = "player"

    id = Column(String(36), primary_key=True)
    coins = Column(Integer)
    goods = Column(Integer)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'Player(id={self.id!r}, coins={self.coins!r}, goods={self.goods!r})'


def random_player(amount: int) -> List[Player]:
    players = []
    for _ in range(amount):
        players.append(Player(id=uuid.uuid4(), coins=10000, goods=10000))

    return players


def simple_example() -> None:
    with Session() as session:
        # create a player, who has a coin and a goods.
        session.add(Player(id="test", coins=1, goods=1))

        # get this player, and print it.
        get_test_stmt = select(Player).where(Player.id == "test")
        for player in session.scalars(get_test_stmt):
            print(player)

        # create players with bulk inserts.
        # insert 1919 players totally, with 114 players per batch.
        # each player has a random UUID
        player_list = random_player(1919)
        for idx in range(0, len(player_list), 114):
            session.bulk_save_objects(player_list[idx:idx + 114])

        # print the number of players
        count = session.query(func.count(Player.id)).scalar()
        print(f'number of players: {count}')

        # print 3 players.
        three_players = session.query(Player).limit(3).all()
        for player in three_players:
            print(player)

        session.commit()


def trade_check(session: Session, sell_id: str, buy_id: str, amount: int, price: int) -> bool:
    # sell player goods check
    sell_player = session.query(Player.goods).filter(Player.id == sell_id).with_for_update().one()
    if sell_player.goods < amount:
        print(f'sell player {sell_id} goods not enough')
        return False

    # buy player coins check
    buy_player = session.query(Player.coins).filter(Player.id == buy_id).with_for_update().one()
    if buy_player.coins < price:
        print(f'buy player {buy_id} coins not enough')
        return False


def trade(sell_id: str, buy_id: str, amount: int, price: int) -> None:
    with Session() as session:
        if trade_check(session, sell_id, buy_id, amount, price) is False:
            return

        # deduct the goods of seller, and raise his/her the coins
        session.query(Player).filter(Player.id == sell_id). \
            update({'goods': Player.goods - amount, 'coins': Player.coins + price})
        # deduct the coins of buyer, and raise his/her the goods
        session.query(Player).filter(Player.id == buy_id). \
            update({'goods': Player.goods + amount, 'coins': Player.coins - price})

        session.commit()
        print("trade success")


def trade_example() -> None:
    with Session() as session:
        # create two players
        # player 1: id is "1", has only 100 coins.
        # player 2: id is "2", has 114514 coins, and 20 goods.
        session.add(Player(id="1", coins=100, goods=0))
        session.add(Player(id="2", coins=114514, goods=20))
        session.commit()

    # player 1 wants to buy 10 goods from player 2.
    # it will cost 500 coins, but player 1 cannot afford it.
    # so this trade will fail, and nobody will lose their coins or goods
    trade(sell_id="2", buy_id="1", amount=10, price=500)

    # then player 1 has to reduce the incoming quantity to 2.
    # this trade will be successful
    trade(sell_id="2", buy_id="1", amount=2, price=100)

    with Session() as session:
        traders = session.query(Player).filter(Player.id.in_(("1", "2"))).all()
        for player in traders:
            print(player)
        session.commit()


simple_example()
trade_example()
```

Compared with using drivers directly, SQLAlchemy provides an abstraction for the specific details of different databases when you create a database connection. In addition, SQLAlchemy encapsulates some operations such as session management and CRUD of basic objects, which greatly simplifies the code.

The `Player` class is a mapping of a table to attributes in the application. Each attribute of `Player` corresponds to a field in the `player` table. To provide SQLAlchemy with more information, the attribute is defined as `id = Column(String(36), primary_key=True)` to indicate the field type and its additional attributes. For example, `id = Column(String(36), primary_key=True)` indicates that the `id` attribute is `String` type, the corresponding field in database is `VARCHAR` type, the length is `36`, and it is a primary key.

For more information about how to use SQLAlchemy, refer to [SQLAlchemy documentation](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/).

## Step 3. Run the code

The following content introduces how to run the code step by step.

### Step 3.1 Initialize table

Before running the code, you need to initialize the table manually. If you are using a local TiDB cluster, you can run the following command:

<SimpleTab groupId="cli">

<div label="MySQL CLI" value="mysql-client">

```shell
mysql --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4000 -u root < player_init.sql
```

</div>

<div label="MyCLI" value="mycli">

```shell
mycli --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4000 -u root --no-warn < player_init.sql
```

</div>

</SimpleTab>

If you are not using a local cluster, or have not installed a MySQL client, connect to your cluster using your preferred method (such as Navicat, DBeaver, or other GUI tools) and run the SQL statements in the `player_init.sql` file.

### Step 3.2 Modify parameters for TiDB Cloud

If you are using a TiDB Serverless cluster, you need to provide your CA root path and replace `<ca_path>` in the following examples with your CA path. To get the CA root path on your system, refer to [Where is the CA root path on my system?](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/secure-connections-to-serverless-tier-clusters#where-is-the-ca-root-path-on-my-system).

If you are using a TiDB Serverless cluster, modify the parameters of the `create_engine` function in `sqlalchemy_example.py`:

```python
engine = create_engine('mysql://root:@127.0.0.1:4000/test')
```

Suppose that the password you set is `123456`, and the connection parameters you get from the cluster details page are the following:

- Endpoint: `xxx.tidbcloud.com`
- Port: `4000`
- User: `2aEp24QWEDLqRFs.root`

In this case, you can modify the `create_engine` as follows:

```python
engine = create_engine('mysql://2aEp24QWEDLqRFs.root:123456@xxx.tidbcloud.com:4000/test', connect_args={
    "ssl_mode": "VERIFY_IDENTITY",
    "ssl": {
        "ca": "<ca_path>"
    }
})
```

### Step 3.3 Run the code

Before running the code, use the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirement.txt
```

If you need to run the script multiple times, follow the [Table initialization](#step-31-initialize-table) section to initialize the table again before each run.

```bash
python3 sqlalchemy_example.py
```
