# Connect to TiDB with DBeaver

TiDB is a MySQL-compatible database, and [DBeaver Community](https://dbeaver.io/download/) is a free cross-platform database tool for developers, database administrators, analysts, and everyone working with data.

In this tutorial, you can learn how to connect to your TiDB cluster using DBeaver Community.

> **Note:**
>
> This tutorial is compatible with TiDB Serverless, TiDB Dedicated, and TiDB Self-Hosted.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need:

- [DBeaver Community **23.0.3** or higher](https://dbeaver.io/download/).
- A TiDB cluster.

**If you don't have a TiDB cluster, you can create one as follows:**

- (Recommended) Follow [Creating a TiDB Serverless cluster](/develop/dev-guide-build-cluster-in-cloud.md) to create your own TiDB Cloud cluster.
- Follow [Deploy a local test TiDB cluster](/quick-start-with-tidb.md#deploy-a-local-test-cluster) or [Deploy a production TiDB cluster](/production-deployment-using-tiup.md) to create a local cluster.

## Connect to TiDB

Connect to your TiDB cluster depending on the TiDB deployment option you've selected.

<SimpleTab>
<div label="TiDB Serverless">

1. Navigate to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page, and then click the name of your target cluster to go to its overview page.

2. Click **Connect** in the upper-right corner. A connection dialog is displayed.

3. Ensure the configurations in the connection dialog match your operating environment.

    - **Endpoint Type** is set to `Public`
    - **Branch** is set to `main`
    - **Connect With** is set to `DBeaver`
    - **Operating System** matches your environment.

4. Click **Generate Password** to create a random password.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > If you have created a password before, you can either use the original password or click **Reset Password** to generate a new one.

5. Launch DBeaver and click **New Database Connection** in the upper-left corner. In the **Connect to a database** dialog, select **TiDB** from the list, and then click **Next**.
