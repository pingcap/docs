# Connect to TiDB with JetBrains DataGrip

TiDB is a MySQL-compatible database, and [JetBrains DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/datagrip/getting-started.html) is a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) for database and SQL. This tutorial walks you through the process of connecting to your TiDB cluster using DataGrip.

> **Note:**
>
> This tutorial is compatible with TiDB Serverless, TiDB Dedicated, and TiDB Self-Hosted.

You can use DataGrip in two ways:

- As the [DataGrip IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/download) standalone tool.
- As the [Database Tools and SQL plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/relational-databases.html) in JetBrains IDEs, such as IntelliJ, PhpStorm, and PyCharm.

This tutorial mainly focuses on the standalone DataGrip IDE. The steps of connecting to TiDB using the JetBrains Database Tools and SQL plugin in JetBrains IDEs are similar. You can also follow the steps in this document for reference when connecting to TiDB from any JetBrains IDE.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need:

- [DataGrip **2023.2.1** or later](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/download/) or a non-community edition [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) IDE.
- A TiDB cluster.

**If you don't have a TiDB cluster, you can create one as follows:**

- (Recommended) Follow [Creating a TiDB Serverless cluster](/develop/dev-guide-build-cluster-in-cloud.md) to create your own TiDB Cloud cluster.
- Follow [Deploy a local test TiDB cluster](/quick-start-with-tidb.md#deploy-a-local-test-cluster) or [Deploy a production TiDB cluster](/production-deployment-using-tiup.md) to create a local cluster.

## Connect to TiDB

Connect to your TiDB cluster depending on the TiDB deployment option you've selected.

<SimpleTab>
<div label="TiDB Serverless">

1. Navigate to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page, and then click the name of your target cluster to go to its overview page.

2. Click **Connect** in the upper-right corner. A connection dialog is displayed.

3. Ensure the configurations in the connection dialog match your operating environment.

    - **Endpoint Type** is set to `Public`
    - **Branch** is set to `main`
    - **Connect With** is set to `DataGrip`
    - **Operating System** matches your environment.

4. Click **Generate Password** to create a random password.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > If you have created a password before, you can either use the original password or click **Reset Password** to generate a new one.

5. Launch DataGrip and create a project to manage your connections.

7. Copy the connection string from the TiDB Cloud connection dialog. Then, paste it into the **URL** field, and the remaining parameters will be auto-populated. An example result is as follows:

    ![Configure the URL field for TiDB Serverless](/media/develop/datagrip-url-paste.jpg)

    If a **Download missing driver files** warning displays, click **Download** to acquire the driver files.

8. Click **Test Connection** to validate the connection to the TiDB Serverless cluster.

<div label="TiDB Dedicated">

1. Navigate to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page, and then click the name of your target cluster to go to its overview page.

2. Click **Connect** in the upper-right corner. A connection dialog is displayed.

3. Click **Allow Access from Anywhere** and then click **Download CA cert** to download the CA certificate.

    For more details about how to obtain the connection string, refer to [TiDB Dedicated standard connection](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/connect-via-standard-connection).

4. Launch DataGrip and create a project to manage your connections.

6. Copy and paste the appropriate connection string into the **Data Source and Drivers** window in DataGrip. The mappings between DataGrip fields and TiDB Dedicated connection string are as follows:

    | DataGrip field | TiDB Dedicated connection string |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------- |
    | Host           | `{host}`                        |
    | Port           | `{port}`                        |
