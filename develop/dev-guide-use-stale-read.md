# Stale Read

Stale Read is a mechanism for reading historical data versions. With the Stale Read feature, you can read the corresponding historical data from a specified time point or time rangeï¼Œso that it can reduce the latency of reading data in scenarios where strong data consistency is not required. When using stale read, TiDB randomly selects a replica to read data by default, so it can utilize the processing power of all nodes that have replicas.

In practice, please determine if it is appropriate to enable Stale in TiDB based on the usage [scenario](/stale-read.md#usage-scenarios-of-stale-read). If your application cannot tolerate reading non-real-time data, do not enable stale read feature, otherwise the data read may not be the latest successfully written data.

TiDB provides us with three levels of stale read features: statement level, transaction level, and session level. Next, we will introduce them one by one:

## Introduce

In the [Bookshop](/develop/dev-guide-bookshop-schema-design.md) application, you can query the latest published books and their prices through the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT id, title, type, price FROM books ORDER BY published_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

```
+------------+------------------------------+-----------------------+--------+
| id         | title                        | type                  | price  |
+------------+------------------------------+-----------------------+--------+
| 3181093216 | The Story of Droolius Caesar | Novel                 | 100.00 |
| 1064253862 | Collin Rolfson               | Education & Reference |  92.85 |
| 1748583991 | The Documentary of cat       | Magazine              | 159.75 |
|  893930596 | Myrl Hills                   | Education & Reference | 356.85 |
| 3062833277 | Keven Wyman                  | Life                  | 477.91 |
+------------+------------------------------+-----------------------+--------+
5 rows in set (0.02 sec)
```

We see that in the list at this time (2022-04-20 15:20:00), the price of **The Story of Droolius Caesar** is 100.0 dollars.

At the same time, the seller found that the book was very popular, so he raised the price of the book to 150.0 dollars through the following SQL statement.

```sql
UPDATE books SET price = 150 WHERE id = 3181093216;
```

```
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0
```

When we checked the latest book list again, it was found that the price of this book had indeed increased.

```
+------------+------------------------------+-----------------------+--------+
| id         | title                        | type                  | price  |
+------------+------------------------------+-----------------------+--------+
| 3181093216 | The Story of Droolius Caesar | Novel                 | 150.00 |
| 1064253862 | Collin Rolfson               | Education & Reference |  92.85 |
| 1748583991 | The Documentary of cat       | Magazine              | 159.75 |
|  893930596 | Myrl Hills                   | Education & Reference | 356.85 |
| 3062833277 | Keven Wyman                  | Life                  | 477.91 |
+------------+------------------------------+-----------------------+--------+
5 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

If we do not require the use of the latest data, we can let TiDB directly return historical data that may have expired through the Stale Read feature to avoid the delay caused by data synchronization when using strong consistency read.

Assuming that in the Bookshop application, when users browse the book list page, we do not require the real-time price of books, only when users click to view the book details page or place an order to obtain real-time price information, we can use stale read feature to further improve the throughput of the application.

## Statement level

<SimpleTab>
<div label="SQL">

You can add the `AS OF TIMESTAMP <datetime>` clause to the above price query statement to view the price of the book before a fixed point in time.

```sql
SELECT id, title, type, price FROM books AS OF TIMESTAMP '2022-04-20 15:20:00' ORDER BY published_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

```
+------------+------------------------------+-----------------------+--------+
| id         | title                        | type                  | price  |
+------------+------------------------------+-----------------------+--------+
| 3181093216 | The Story of Droolius Caesar | Novel                 | 100.00 |
| 1064253862 | Collin Rolfson               | Education & Reference |  92.85 |
| 1748583991 | The Documentary of cat       | Magazine              | 159.75 |
|  893930596 | Myrl Hills                   | Education & Reference | 356.85 |
| 3062833277 | Keven Wyman                  | Life                  | 477.91 |
+------------+------------------------------+-----------------------+--------+
5 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

In addition to specifying the exact point in time, you can also use:

- `AS OF TIMESTAMP NOW() - INTERVAL 10 SECOND` indicates that the latest data was read 10 seconds ago.
- `AS OF TIMESTAMP TIDB_BOUNDED_STALENESS('2016-10-08 16:45:26', '2016-10-08 16:45:29')` indicates reading data that is as new as possible in the time range of 16:45:26 seconds to 29 seconds on October 8, 2016.
- `AS OF TIMESTAMP TIDB_BOUNDED_STALENESS(NOW() -INTERVAL 20 SECOND, NOW())` indicates to read data as new as possible within the time range from 20 seconds ago to the present.

It should be noted that the set timestamp or the range of timestamps cannot be too early or later than the current time.

Expired data will be recycled by [Garbage Collection](/garbage-collection-overview.md) in TiDB, and the data will be retained for a short period of time before being cleared. The time is called [GC Life Time (default 10 minutes)](/system-variables.md#tidb_gc_life_time-new-in-v50). Each time a GC is performed, the value of the current time minus the time period will be used as the **GC Safe Point**. If you try to read the data before GC Safe Point, TiDB will report the following error:

```
ERROR 9006 (HY000): GC life time is shorter than transaction duration...
```

If the given timestamp is a future time node, TiDB will report the following error:

```
ERROR 9006 (HY000): cannot set read timestamp to a future time.
```

    // Try to stale read the data before 20 minutes.
    bookDAO.getTop5LatestBooksWithStaleRead(20 * 60);

Through the results, you can see that the price before the update of 100.00 dollars was read through stale read.

```
The latest book price (before update): 100.00

</SimpleTab>

## Transaction level

With the `START TRANSACTION READ ONLY AS OF TIMESTAMP` statement, you can start a read-only transaction based on historical time, which reads historical data based on the provided historical time.

<SimpleTab>
<div label="SQL">

For example:

```sql
START TRANSACTION READ ONLY AS OF TIMESTAMP NOW() - INTERVAL 5 SECOND;
```

We tried to query the price of the latest book through SQL, and found that the price of **The Story of Droolius Caesar** is still the price of 100.0 dollars before the update.

```sql
SELECT id, title, type, price FROM books ORDER BY published_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

```
+------------+------------------------------+-----------------------+--------+
| id         | title                        | type                  | price  |
+------------+------------------------------+-----------------------+--------+
| 3181093216 | The Story of Droolius Caesar | Novel                 | 100.00 |
| 1064253862 | Collin Rolfson               | Education & Reference |  92.85 |
| 1748583991 | The Documentary of cat       | Magazine              | 159.75 |
|  893930596 | Myrl Hills                   | Education & Reference | 356.85 |
| 3062833277 | Keven Wyman                  | Life                  | 477.91 |
+------------+------------------------------+-----------------------+--------+
5 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

Then we commit the transaction through the `COMMIT;` statement, and when the transaction ends, we can read the latest data again:

```
+------------+------------------------------+-----------------------+--------+
| id         | title                        | type                  | price  |
+------------+------------------------------+-----------------------+--------+
| 3181093216 | The Story of Droolius Caesar | Novel                 | 150.00 |
| 1064253862 | Collin Rolfson               | Education & Reference |  92.85 |
| 1748583991 | The Documentary of cat       | Magazine              | 159.75 |
|  893930596 | Myrl Hills                   | Education & Reference | 356.85 |
| 3062833277 | Keven Wyman                  | Life                  | 477.91 |
+------------+------------------------------+-----------------------+--------+
5 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

</div>
<div label="Java">

We can start by defining a tool class for transactions that encapsulates the command to open a transaction level with stale read as a tool method.

```java
public static class StaleReadHelper {

    public static void startTxnWithStaleRead(Connection conn, Integer seconds) throws SQLException {
        conn.setAutoCommit(false);
        PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(
            "START TRANSACTION READ ONLY AS OF TIMESTAMP NOW() - INTERVAL ? SECOND;"
        );
        stmt.setInt(1, seconds);
        stmt.execute();
    }

}
```

Then we define a method in the `BookDAO` class that enables the stale read feature through a transaction, in which we query for the latest list of books, but do not add `AS OF TIMESTAMP` to the query statement.

```java
public class BookDAO {

    // Omit some code...

    public List<Book> getTop5LatestBooksWithTxnStaleRead(Integer seconds) throws SQLException {
        List<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();
        try (Connection conn = ds.getConnection()) {
            // Start a read only transaction.
            TxnHelper.startTxnWithStaleRead(conn, seconds);

            Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("""
            SELECT id, title, type, price FROM books ORDER BY published_at DESC LIMIT 5;
            """);
            while (rs.next()) {
                Book book = new Book();
                book.setId(rs.getLong("id"));
                book.setTitle(rs.getString("title"));
                book.setType(rs.getString("type"));
                book.setPrice(rs.getDouble("price"));
                books.add(book);
            }

            // Commit transaction.
            conn.commit();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            if ("HY000".equals(e.getSQLState()) && e.getErrorCode() == 1105) {
                System.out.println("WARN: cannot set read timestamp to a future time.");
            } else if ("HY000".equals(e.getSQLState()) && e.getErrorCode() == 9006) {
                System.out.println("WARN: GC life time is shorter than transaction duration.");
            } else {
                throw e;
            }
        }
        return books;
    }
}
```

```java
List<Book> top5LatestBooks = bookDAO.getTop5LatestBooks();

if (top5LatestBooks.size() > 0) {
    System.out.println("The latest book price (before update): " + top5LatestBooks.get(0).getPrice());

    Book book = top5LatestBooks.get(0);
    bookDAO.updateBookPriceByID(book.getId(), book.price + 10);

    top5LatestBooks = bookDAO.getTop5LatestBooks();
    System.out.println("The latest book price (after update): " + top5LatestBooks.get(0).getPrice());

    // Use the stale read.
    top5LatestBooks = bookDAO.getTop5LatestBooksWithTxnStaleRead(5);
    System.out.println("The latest book price (maybe stale): " + top5LatestBooks.get(0).getPrice());

    // After the stale read transaction is committed.
    top5LatestBooks = bookDAO.getTop5LatestBooks();
    System.out.println("The latest book price (after the transaction commit): " + top5LatestBooks.get(0).getPrice());
}
```

Output result:

```
The latest book price (before update): 100.00
The latest book price (after update): 150.00
The latest book price (maybe stale): 100.00
The latest book price (after the transaction commit): 150
```

</SimpleTab>

With the `SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY AS OF TIMESTAMP` statement, you can set the opened transaction or the next transaction to be a read-only transaction based on a specified historical time. The transaction will read historical data based on the provided historical time.

<SimpleTab>
<div label="SQL">

For example, we can switch the opened transaction to read-only mode through the following SQL, and enable the Stale Read feature that can read historical data 5 seconds ago through the `AS OF TIMESTAMP` statement.

```sql
SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY AS OF TIMESTAMP NOW() - INTERVAL 5 SECOND;
```

</div>
<div label="Java">

We can start by defining a tool class for transactions that encapsulates the command to open a transaction level stale read as a tool method.

```java
public static class TxnHelper {

    public static void setTxnWithStaleRead(Connection conn, Integer seconds) throws SQLException {
        PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(
            "SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY AS OF TIMESTAMP NOW() - INTERVAL ? SECOND;"
        );
        stmt.setInt(1, seconds);
        stmt.execute();
    }

}
```

Then we define a method in the `BookDAO` class that enables the stale read feature through a transaction, in which we query for the latest list of books, but do not add `AS OF TIMESTAMP` to the query statement.

```java
public class BookDAO {

    // Omit some code...

    public List<Book> getTop5LatestBooksWithTxnStaleRead2(Integer seconds) throws SQLException {
        List<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();
        try (Connection conn = ds.getConnection()) {
            StaleReadHelper.setTxnWithStaleRead(conn, seconds);

            // Start a read only transaction.
            conn.setAutoCommit(false);

            Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("""

        return books;

## Session level

To support reading historical version data, TiDB has introduced a new system variable `tidb_read_staleness` since version 5.4. The system variable `tidb_read_staleness` is used to set the range of historical data that the current session is allowed to read. Its data type is int and its scope is SESSION.

<SimpleTab>
<div label="SQL">

Enable stale read in a session:

```sql
SET @@tidb_read_staleness="-5";
```

 For example, if the value of this variable is set to -5, on the condition that TiKV has the corresponding historical version's data, TiDB selects a timestamp as new as possible within a 5-second time range.

Close stale read in the session:

```sql
set @@tidb_read_staleness="";
```

</div>
<div label="Java">

```java
public static class StaleReadHelper{

    public static void enableStaleReadOnSession(Connection conn, Integer seconds) throws SQLException {
        PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(
            "SET @@tidb_read_staleness= ?;"
        );
        stmt.setString(1, String.format("-%d", seconds));
        stmt.execute();
    }

    public static void disableStaleReadOnSession(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
        PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(
            "SET @@tidb_read_staleness=\"\";"
        );
        stmt.execute();
    }

}
```
