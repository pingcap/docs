# Choose Driver or ORM

> **Note:**
>
> TiDB provides the following two support levels for drivers and ORMs:
>
> - **Full**: indicates that TiDB is compatible with most features of the tool and maintains compatibility with its newer versions. PingCAP will periodically conduct compatibility tests with the latest version of [Third-party tools supported by TiDB](/develop/dev-guide-third-party-support.md).
> - **Compatible**: indicates that because the corresponding third-party tool is adapted to MySQL and TiDB is highly compatible with the MySQL protocol, so TiDB can use most features of the tool. However, PingCAP has not completed a full test on all features of the tool, which might lead to some unexpected behaviors.
>
> For more information, refer to [Third-Party Tools Supported by TiDB](/develop/dev-guide-third-party-support.md).

TiDB is highly compatible with the MySQL protocol but some features are incompatible with MySQL. For a full list of compatibility differences, see [MySQL Compatibility](/mysql-compatibility.md).

## Java

This section describes how to use drivers and ORM frameworks in Java.

### Java drivers

<SimpleTab>
<div label="MySQL-JDBC">

Support level: **Full**

You can follow the [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/8.0/en/) to download and configure a Java JDBC driver. It is recommended to use MySQL Connector/J 8.0.33 or later with TiDB v6.3.0 and newer.

> **Tip:**
>
> There is a [bug](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=106252) in the Connector/J 8.0 versions before 8.0.32, which might cause threads to hang when using TiDB versions earlier than v6.3.0. To avoid this issue, it is recommended that you use either MySQL Connector/J 8.0.32 or a later version, or the TiDB JDBC (see the *TiDB-JDBC* tab).

For an example of how to build a complete application, see [Build a simple CRUD app with TiDB and JDBC](/develop/dev-guide-sample-application-java-jdbc.md).

</div>
<div label="TiDB-JDBC">

Support level: **Full**

[TiDB-JDBC](https://github.com/pingcap/mysql-connector-j) is a customized Java driver based on MySQL 8.0.29. Compiled based on MySQL official version 8.0.29, TiDB-JDBC fixes the bug of multi-parameter and multi-field EOF in the prepare mode in the original JDBC, and adds features such as automatic TiCDC snapshot maintenance and the SM3 authentication plugin.

Using SM3-based authentication is only supported with the TiDB version of MySQL Connector/J.

If you use Maven, add the following content to the `<dependencies></dependencies>` section in the `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.lastincisor</groupId>
  <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
  <version>8.0.29-tidb-1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

If you need to enable SM3 authentication, add the following content to the `<dependencies></dependencies>` section in the `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.lastincisor</groupId>
  <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
  <version>8.0.29-tidb-1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>
    <artifactId>bcprov-jdk15on</artifactId>
    <version>1.67</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>
    <artifactId>bcpkix-jdk15on</artifactId>
    <version>1.67</version>
</dependency>
```

If you use Gradle, add the following content to `dependencies`:

```gradle
implementation group: 'io.github.lastincisor', name: 'mysql-connector-java', version: '8.0.29-tidb-1.0.0'
implementation group: 'org.bouncycastle', name: 'bcprov-jdk15on', version: '1.67'
implementation group: 'org.bouncycastle', name: 'bcpkix-jdk15on', version: '1.67'
```

</div>
</SimpleTab>

### Java ORM frameworks

> **Note:**
>
> - Currently, Hibernate does [not support nested transactions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37927208/nested-transaction-in-spring-app-with-jpa-postgres).
>
> - Since v6.2.0, TiDB supports [savepoint](/sql-statements/sql-statement-savepoint.md). To use the `Propagation.NESTED` transaction propagation option in `@Transactional`, that is, to set `@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NESTED)`, make sure that your TiDB is v6.2.0 or later.

<SimpleTab>
<div label="Hibernate">

Support level: **Full**

To avoid manually managing complex relationships between different dependencies of an application, you can use [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install) or [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) to get all dependencies of your application, including those indirect ones. Note that only Hibernate `6.0.0.Beta2` or above supports the TiDB dialect.

If you are using **Maven**, add the following to your `<dependencies></dependencies>`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.orm</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-core</artifactId>
    <version>6.0.0.CR2</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
    <version>5.1.49</version>
</dependency>
```

If you are using **Gradle**, add the following to your `dependencies`:

```gradle
implementation 'org.hibernate:hibernate-core:6.0.0.CR2'
implementation 'mysql:mysql-connector-java:5.1.49'
```

- For an example of using Hibernate to build a TiDB application by native Java, see [Build a simple CRUD app with TiDB and Hibernate](/develop/dev-guide-sample-application-java-hibernate.md).
- For an example of using Spring Data JPA or Hibernate to build a TiDB application by Spring, see [Build a TiDB app using Spring Boot](/develop/dev-guide-sample-application-java-spring-boot.md).

In addition, you need to specify the TiDB dialect in your [Hibernate configuration file](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/hibernate/hibernate_configuration.htm): `org.hibernate.dialect.TiDBDialect`, which is only supported by Hibernate `6.0.0.Beta2` or above. If your `Hibernate` version is earlier than `6.0.0.Beta2`, upgrade it first.

> **Note:**
>
> If you are unable to upgrade your `Hibernate` version, use the MySQL 5.7 dialect `org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL57Dialect` instead. However, this setting might cause unpredictable results and the absence of some TiDB-specific features, such as [sequences](/sql-statements/sql-statement-create-sequence.md).

</div>

<div label="MyBatis">

Support level: **Full**

To avoid manually managing complex relationships between different dependencies of an application, you can use [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install) or [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) to get all dependencies of your application, including those indirect dependencies.

If you are using Maven, add the following to your `<dependencies></dependencies>`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mybatis</groupId>
    <artifactId>mybatis</artifactId>
    <version>3.5.9</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
    <version>5.1.49</version>
</dependency>
```

If you are using Gradle, add the following to your `dependencies`:

```gradle
implementation 'org.mybatis:mybatis:3.5.9'
implementation 'mysql:mysql-connector-java:5.1.49'
```

For an example of using MyBatis to build a TiDB application, see [Build a simple CRUD app with TiDB and Mybatis](/develop/dev-guide-sample-application-java-mybatis.md).

### Java client load balancing

**tidb-loadbalance**

Support level: **Full**

[tidb-loadbalance](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-loadbalance) is a load balancing component on the application side. With tidb-loadbalance, you can automatically maintain the node information of TiDB server and distribute JDBC connections on the client using the tidb-loadbalance policies. Using a direct JDBC connection between the client application and TiDB server has higher performance than using the load balancing component.

Currently, tidb-loadbalance supports the following policies: roundrobin, random, and weight.

> **Note:**
>
> tidb-loadbalance must be used with [mysql-connector-j](https://github.com/pingcap/mysql-connector-j).

If you use Maven, add the following content to the element body of `<dependencies></dependencies>` in the `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.lastincisor</groupId>
  <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
  <version>8.0.29-tidb-1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.lastincisor</groupId>
  <artifactId>tidb-loadbalance</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.5</version>
</dependency>
```

If you use Gradle, add the following content to `dependencies`:

```gradle
implementation group: 'io.github.lastincisor', name: 'mysql-connector-java', version: '8.0.29-tidb-1.0.0'
implementation group: 'io.github.lastincisor', name: 'tidb-loadbalance', version: '0.0.5'
```

## Golang

This section describes how to use drivers and ORM frameworks in Golang.

### Golang drivers

**go-sql-driver/mysql**

Support level: **Full**

To download and configure a Golang driver, refer to the [go-sql-driver/mysql documentation](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql).
