# Build a TiDB cluster in TiDB Cloud (DevTier)

This document walks you through the quickest way to get started with TiDB. You will use [TiDB Cloud](https://en.pingcap.com/tidb-cloud) to create a free TiDB cluster, connect to it, and run a sample application on it.

If you need to run TiDB on your local machine, see [Starting TiDB Locally](/quick-start-with-tidb.md).

## Step 1. Create a free cluster

1. If you do not have a TiDB Cloud account, click [TiDB Cloud](https://tidbcloud.com/free-trial) to sign up for an account.
2. [Sign in](https://tidbcloud.com/) with your TiDB Cloud account.
3. To create a Developer Tier cluster for one year free, you can either select the **Developer Tier** plan on the [plan page](https://tidbcloud.com/console/plans) or click [Create Cluster](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) and select **Developer Tier** on the **Create Cluster** page.
4. On the **Create Cluster** page, set up your cluster name, cloud provider (for now, only AWS is available for Developer Tier), and region (a nearby region is recommended). Then click **Create** to create your cluster.
5. Your TiDB Cloud cluster will be created in approximately 5 to 15 minutes. You can check the creation progress at [Active Clusters](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters).
6. After creating a cluster, on the **Active Clusters** page, click the name of your newly created cluster to navigate to the cluster control panel.

7. Click **Connect** to create a traffic filter (a list of client IPs allowed for TiDB connection).

    ![connect](/media/develop/IMG_20220331-232726165.png)

8. In the popup window, click **Add Your Current IP Address** to fill in your current IP address, and then click **Create Filter** to create a traffic filter.
9. Copy the string to connect with a SQL client for later use.

## Step 2. Connect to a cluster

1. If the MySQL client is not installed, select your operating system and follow the steps below to install it.

<SimpleTab>

<div label="macOS">

For macOS, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index) if you do not have it, and then run the following command to install the MySQL client:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
brew install mysql-client
```

The output is as follows:

```
mysql-client is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because it conflicts with mysql (which contains client libraries).

If you need to have mysql-client first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find mysql-client you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client/include"
```

To add the MySQL client to your PATH, locate the following command in the above output (if your output is inconsistent with the above output in the document, use the corresponding command in your output instead) and run it:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Then, declare the global environment variable by the `source` command and verify that the MySQL client is installed successfully:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
source ~/.zshrc
mysql --version
```

An example of the expected output:

```
mysql  Ver 8.0.28 for macos12.0 on arm64 (Homebrew)
```

</div>

<div label="Linux">

For Linux, the following takes CentOS 7 as an example:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
yum install mysql
```

Then, verify that the MySQL client is installed successfully:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
mysql --version
```

An example of the expected output:

```
mysql  Ver 15.1 Distrib 5.5.68-MariaDB, for Linux (x86_64) using readline 5.1
```

</div>

</SimpleTab>

2. Run the connection string obtained in [Step 1](#step-1-create-a-free-cluster).

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
mysql --connect-timeout 15 -u root -h <host> -P 4000 -p
```

3. Fill in the password to sign in.

## Step 3. Run the sample application

1. Clone the `tidb-example-java` project:

  {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/pingcap-inc/tidb-example-java.git
  ```

2. Change connection parameters.

  <SimpleTab>

  <div label="Local default cluster">

  No changes are required.

  </div>

  <div label="Non-local default cluster, TiDB Cloud, or other remote cluster">

  In `plain-java-jdbc/src/main/java/com/pingcap/JDBCExample.java`, modify the parameters of the host, port, user, and password:

  {{< copyable "" >}}

  ```java
  mysqlDataSource.setServerName("localhost");
  mysqlDataSource.setPortNumber(4000);
  mysqlDataSource.setDatabaseName("test");
  mysqlDataSource.setUser("root");
  mysqlDataSource.setPassword("");
  ```

  Suppose that the password you set is `123456` and the connection string you get from TiDB Cloud is the following:

  {{< copyable "" >}}

  ```shell
  mysql --connect-timeout 15 -u root -h xxx.tidbcloud.com -P 4000 -p
  ```

  In this case, you can modify the parameters as follows:

  {{< copyable "" >}}

  ```java
  mysqlDataSource.setServerName("xxx.tidbcloud.com");
  mysqlDataSource.setPortNumber(4000);
  mysqlDataSource.setDatabaseName("test");
  mysqlDataSource.setUser("root");
  mysqlDataSource.setPassword("123456");
  ```

  </div>

  </SimpleTab>

3. Run `make plain-java-jdbc`.

  Here is an example of the [expected output](https://github.com/pingcap-inc/tidb-example-java/blob/main/Expected-Output.md#plain-java-jdbc).
