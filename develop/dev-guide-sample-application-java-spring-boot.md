# Build a TiDB App Using Spring Boot

This tutorial shows you how to build a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) web application using TiDB. The [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa) module is used as the framework for data access capabilities. You can download the code for this sample application from [GitHub](https://github.com/pingcap-inc/tidb-example-java).

This is a sample application for building a RESTful API, which shows a generic **Spring Boot** backend service using **TiDB** as the database. The following process was designed to recreate a real-world scenario:

This is an example of a game where each player has two attributes: `coins` and `goods`. Each player is uniquely identified by an `id` field. Players can trade freely if they have sufficient coins and goods.

You can build your own application based on this example.

## Step 1: Launch your TiDB cluster

<CustomContent platform="tidb">

The following introduces how to start a TiDB cluster.

**Use a TiDB Serverless cluster**

For detailed steps, see [Create a TiDB Serverless cluster](/develop/dev-guide-build-cluster-in-cloud.md#step-1-create-a-tidb-serverless-cluster).

**Use a local cluster**

For detailed steps, see [Deploy a local test cluster](/quick-start-with-tidb.md#deploy-a-local-test-cluster) or [Deploy a TiDB Cluster Using TiUP](/production-deployment-using-tiup.md).

See [Create a TiDB Serverless cluster](/develop/dev-guide-build-cluster-in-cloud.md#step-1-create-a-tidb-serverless-cluster).

</CustomContent>

## Step 2: Install JDK

Download and install the **Java Development Kit** (JDK) on your computer. It is a necessary tool for Java development. **Spring Boot** supports JDK for Java 8 and later versions. However, due to the **Hibernate** version, it is recommended that you use JDK for Java 11 and later versions.

Both **Oracle JDK** and **OpenJDK** are supported. You can choose at your own discretion. This tutorial uses JDK 17 from **OpenJDK**.

## Step 3: Install Maven

This sample application uses **Apache Maven** to manage the application's dependencies. Spring supports Maven 3.3 and later versions. As dependency management software, the latest stable version of **Maven** is recommended.

To install **Maven** from the command line.

- macOS:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    brew install maven
    ```

- Debian-based Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu):

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    apt-get install maven
    ```

- Red Hat-based Linux distributions (such as Fedora, CentOS):

    - dnf:

        {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

        ```shell
        dnf install maven
        ```

    - yum:

        {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

        ```shell
        yum install maven
        ```

For other installation methods, refer to the [Maven official documentation](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

## Step 4: Get the application code

Download or clone the [sample code repository](https://github.com/pingcap-inc/tidb-example-java) and navigate to the `spring-jpa-hibernate` directory.

## Step 5: Run the application

In this step, the application code is compiled and run, which produces a web application. Hibernate creates a `player_jpa` table within the `test` database. If you make requests using the application's RESTful API, these requests run [database transactions](/develop/dev-guide-transaction-overview.md) on the TiDB cluster.

If you want to learn more about the code of this application, refer to [Implementation details](#implementation-details).

### Step 5.1 Change parameters

If you are using a TiDB Serverless cluster, change the `spring.datasource.url`, `spring.datasource.username`, `spring.datasource.password` parameters in the `application.yml` (located in `src/main/resources`).

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:4000/test
    username: root
    #    password: xxx
    driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
  jpa:
    show-sql: true
    database-platform: org.hibernate.dialect.TiDBDialect
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: create-drop
```

Suppose that the password you set is `123456`, and the connection parameters you get from the cluster details page are the following:

- Endpoint: `xxx.tidbcloud.com`
- Port: `4000`
- User: `2aEp24QWEDLqRFs.root`

Accordingly, the parameters must be set as folows:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://xxx.tidbcloud.com:4000/test?sslMode=VERIFY_IDENTITY&enabledTLSProtocols=TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3
    username: 2aEp24QWEDLqRFs.root
    password: 123456
    driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
  jpa:
    show-sql: true
    database-platform: org.hibernate.dialect.TiDBDialect
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: create-drop
```

### Step 5.2 Run

Open a terminal session and make sure you are in the `spring-jpa-hibernate` directory. If you are not already in this directory, navigate to the directory with the following command:

```shell
cd <path>/tidb-example-java/spring-jpa-hibernate
```

#### Build and run with Make (recommended)

```shell
make
```

#### Build and run manually

If you prefer to build manually, follow these steps:

1. Clear cache and package:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    mvn clean package
    ```

2. Run applications with JAR files:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    java -jar target/spring-jpa-hibernate-0.0.1.jar
    ```

### Step 5.3 Output

The final part of the output should look like the following:

```

```

The output log indicates the application behavior during startup. In this example, the application starts a **Servlet** using [Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/), uses Hibernate as the ORM, uses [HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP) as the database connection pool implementation, and uses `org.hibernate.dialect.TiDBDialect` as the database dialect. After startup, Hibernate deletes and re-creates the `player_jpa` table and the `player_jpa_id_seq` sequence. At the end of startup, the application listens on port `8080` to provide HTTP services to the outside.

If you want to learn more about the code of this application, refer to [implementation details](#implementation-details).

## Step 6: HTTP requests

After the service is up and running, you can send the HTTP requests to the backend application. <http://localhost:8080> is the base URL that provides services. This tutorial uses a series of HTTP requests to show how to use the service.

### Step 6.1 Use Postman requests (recommended)

You can download this [configuration file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pingcap-inc/tidb-example-java/main/spring-jpa-hibernate/Player.postman_collection.json) locally and import it into [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) as shown here:

![import the collection into Postman](/media/develop/IMG_20220402-003303222.png)

#### Create players

Click on the **Create** tab and the **Send** button to send a POST request to `http://localhost:8080/player/`. The return value is the number of players added, which is expected to be 1.

![Postman-Create a player](/media/develop/IMG_20220402-003350731.png)

#### Get player information by ID

Click on the **GetByID** tab and the **Send** button to send a GET request to `http://localhost:8080/player/1`. The return value is the information of the player with ID `1`.

![Postman-GetByID](/media/develop/IMG_20220402-003416079.png)

#### Get player information in bulk by limit

Click on the **GetByLimit** tab and the **Send** button to send a GET request to `http://localhost:8080/player/limit/3`. The return value is a list of information for up to 3 players.

![Postman-GetByLimit](/media/develop/IMG_20220402-003505846.png)

#### Get player information by page

Click on the **GetByPage** tab and the **Send** button to send a GET request to `http://localhost:8080/player/page?index=0&size=2`. The return value is the page with index `0`, with `2` players per page. The return value also contains the paging information such as offset, totalPages, and sort.

![Postman-GetByPage](/media/develop/IMG_20220402-003528474.png)

#### Count players

Click the **Count** tab and the **Send** button to send a GET request to `http://localhost:8080/player/count`. The return value is the number of players.

![Postman-Count](/media/develop/IMG_20220402-003549966.png)

#### Player trading

Click on the **Trade** tab and the **Send** button to send a PUT request to `http://localhost:8080/player/trade`. The request parameters are the seller's ID `sellID`, the buyer's ID `buyID`, the number of goods purchased `amount`, the number of coins consumed for the purchase `price`.

The return value is whether the transaction is successful or not. When there are insufficient goods for the seller, insufficient coins for the buyer, or a database error, the [database transaction](/develop/dev-guide-transaction-overview.md) guarantees that the trade is not successful and no player's coins or goods are lost.

![Postman-Trade](/media/develop/IMG_20220402-003659102.png)

### Step 6.2 Using curl requests

You can also use curl to make requests directly.

#### Create players

To create players, you can send a **POST** request to the `/player` endpoint. For example:

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/player/' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '[{"coins":100,"goods":20}]'
```

The request uses JSON as the payload. The example above indicates creating a player with 100 `coins` and 20 `goods`. The return value is the number of players created.

```json
1
```

#### Get player information by ID

To get the player information, you can send a **GET** request to the `/player` endpoint. You need to specify the `id` of the player in the path parameter as follows: `/player/{id}`. The following example shows how to get the information of a player with `id` 1:

```shell
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/player/1'
```

The return value is the player's information:

```json
{
  "coins": 200,
  "goods": 10,
  "id": 1
}
```

#### Get player information in bulk by limit

To get the player information in bulk, you can send a **GET** request to the `/player/limit` endpoint. You need to specify the total number of players in the path parameter as follows: `/player/limit/{limit}`. The following example shows how to get the information of up to 3 players:

```shell
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/player/limit/3'
```

The return value is a list of player information:

```json
[
  {
    "coins": 200,
    "goods": 10,
    "id": 1
  },
  {
    "coins": 0,
    "goods": 30,
    "id": 2
  },
  {
    "coins": 100,
    "goods": 20,
    "id": 3
  }
]
```

#### Get player information by page

To get paginated player information, you can send a **GET** request to the `/player/page` endpoint. To specify additional parameters, you need to use the URL parameter. The following example shows how to get the information from a page whose `index` is 0, where each page has a maximum `size` of 2 players.

```shell
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/player/page?index=0&size=2'
```

The return value is the page with `index` 0, where 2 players are listed per page. In addition, the return value contains pagination information such as offset, total pages, and whether the results are sorted.

```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "coins": 200,
      "goods": 10,
      "id": 1
    },
    {
      "coins": 0,
      "goods": 30,
      "id": 2
    }
  ],
  "empty": false,
  "first": true,
  "last": false,
  "number": 0,
  "numberOfElements": 2,
  "pageable": {
    "offset": 0,
    "pageNumber": 0,
    "pageSize": 2,
    "paged": true,
    "sort": {
      "empty": true,
      "sorted": false,
      "unsorted": true
    },
    "unpaged": false
  },
  "size": 2,
  "sort": {
    "empty": true,
    "sorted": false,
    "unsorted": true
  },
  "totalElements": 4,
  "totalPages": 2
}
```

#### Count players

To get the number of players, you can send a **GET** request to the `/player/count` endpoint:

```shell
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/player/count'
```

The return value is the number of players:

```json
4
```

#### Player trading

To initiate a transaction between players, you can send a **PUT** request to the `/player/trade` endpoint. For example:

```shell
curl --location --request PUT 'http://localhost:8080/player/trade' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data-urlencode 'sellID=1' \
  --data-urlencode 'buyID=2' \
  --data-urlencode 'amount=10' \
  --data-urlencode 'price=100'
```

The request uses **Form Data** as the payload. The example request indicates that the seller's ID (`sellID`) is 1, the buyer's ID (`buyID`) is 2, the number of goods purchased (`amount`) is 10, and the number of coins consumed for purchase (`price`) is 100.

The return value is whether the transaction is successful or not. When there are insufficient goods for the seller, insufficient coins for the buyer, or a database error, the [database transaction](/develop/dev-guide-transaction-overview.md) guarantees that the trade is not successful and no player's coins or goods are lost.

```json
true
```

### Step 6.3 Requests with Shell script

You can download [this shell script](https://github.com/pingcap-inc/tidb-example-java/blob/main/spring-jpa-hibernate/request.sh) for testing purposes. The script performs the following operations:

1. Create 10 players in a loop.
2. Get the information of players with the `id` of 1.
3. Get a list of up to 3 players.
4. Get a page of players with the `index` of 0 and the `size` of 2.
5. Get the total number of players.
6. Perform a transaction, where the player with the `id` of 1 is the seller and the player with the `id` of 2 is the buyer, and 10 `goods` are purchased at the cost of 100 `coins`.

You can run this script with `make request` or `./request.sh`. The result should look like this:

```shell
cheese@CheesedeMacBook-Pro spring-jpa-hibernate % make request
./request.sh
loop to create 10 players:
1111111111

get player 1:
{"id":1,"coins":200,"goods":10}

get players by limit 3:
[{"id":1,"coins":200,"goods":10},{"id":2,"coins":0,"goods":30},{"id":3,"coins":100,"goods":20}]

get first players:
{"content":[{"id":1,"coins":200,"goods":10},{"id":2,"coins":0,"goods":30}],"pageable":{"sort":{"empty":true,"unsorted":true,"sorted":false},"offset":0,"pageNumber":0,"pageSize":2,"paged":true,"unpaged":false},"last":false,"totalPages":7,"totalElements":14,"first":true,"size":2,"number":0,"sort":{"empty":true,"unsorted":true,"sorted":false},"numberOfElements":2,"empty":false}

get players count:
14

trade by two players:
false
```

- `pom.xml` declares the project's Maven configuration, such as dependencies and packaging.
- `application.yml` declares the project's user configuration, such as database address, password, and database dialect used.
- `App.java` is the entry point of the project.
- `controller` is the package that exposes the HTTP interface to the outside.
- `service` is the package that implements the interface and logic of the project.
- `dao` is the package that implements the connection to the database and the persistence of the data.

### Configuration

This part briefly describes the Maven configuration in the `pom.xml` file and the user configuration in the `application.yml` file.

#### Maven configuration

The `pom.xml` file is a Maven configuration file that declares the project's Maven dependencies, packaging methods, and packaging information. You can replicate the process of generating this configuration file by [creating a blank application with the same dependency](#create-a-blank-application-with-the-same-dependency-optional), or copying it directly to your project.

#### User configuration

The `application.yml` configuration file declares the user configuration, such as database address, password, and the database dialect used.

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:4000/test
    username: root
    #    password: xxx
    driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
  jpa:
    show-sql: true
    database-platform: org.hibernate.dialect.TiDBDialect
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: create-drop
```

The configuration is written in [YAML](https://yaml.org/). The fields are described as follows:

- `spring.datasource.url` : URL of the database connection.
- `spring.datasource.username` : the database username.
- `spring.datasource.password` : the database password. Empty. You need to comment out or delete this field.
- `spring.datasource.driver-class-name` : the database driver. Because TiDB is compatible with MySQL, use a mysql-connector-java driver class `com.mysql.cj.jdbc`.
- `jpa.show-sql` : when this field is set to `true`, the SQL statements run by JPA are printed.
- `jpa.database-platform` : the selected database dialect. Because the application connects to TiDB, choose **TiDB dialect**. Note that this dialect is only available in Hibernate `6.0.0.Beta2` and later versions, so choose the applicable dependency version.
- `jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` : `create-drop` creates the table at the beginning of the program and deletes the table on exit. Do not set this option in a production environment. Because this is a sample application, this option is set to minimize the impact on the database data.

### Entry point

The `App.java` file is the entry point:

```java
package com.pingcap;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.context.ApplicationPidFileWriter;

@SpringBootApplication
public class App {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      SpringApplication springApplication = new SpringApplication(App.class);
      springApplication.addListeners(new ApplicationPidFileWriter("spring-jpa-hibernate.pid"));
      springApplication.run(args);
   }
}
```

The entry class starts with the standard configuration annotation [`@SpringBootApplication`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/SpringBootApplication.html) for Spring Boot applications. For more information, see [Using the `@SpringBootApplication` Annotation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-spring-boot.html#using-boot-using-springbootapplication-annotation) in the Spring Boot official documentation. Then, the program uses the `ApplicationPidFileWriter` to write a PID (process identification number) file called `spring-jpa-hibernate.pid` during application startup. The PID file can be used to close this application from an external source.

### Data access object

The `dao` (Data Access Object) package implements the persistence of data objects.

#### Entity objects

The `PlayerBean.java` file is an entity object, which corresponds to a table in the database:

```java
package com.pingcap.dao;

import jakarta.persistence.*;

/**
 * it's core entity in hibernate
 * @Table appoint to table name
 */
@Entity
@Table(name = "player_jpa")
public class PlayerBean {
    /**
     * @ID primary key
     * @GeneratedValue generated way. this field will use generator named "player_id"
     * @SequenceGenerator using `sequence` feature to create a generator,
     *    and it named "player_jpa_id_seq" in database, initial form 1 (by `initialValue`
     *    parameter default), and every operator will increase 1 (by `allocationSize`)
     */
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(generator="player_id")
    @SequenceGenerator(name="player_id", sequenceName="player_jpa_id_seq", allocationSize=1)
    private Long id;

    /**
     * @Column field
     */
    @Column(name = "coins")
    private Integer coins;
    @Column(name = "goods")
    private Integer goods;

    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public Integer getCoins() {
        return coins;
    }

    public void setCoins(Integer coins) {
        this.coins = coins;
    }

    public Integer getGoods() {
        return goods;
    }

    public void setGoods(Integer goods) {
        this.goods = goods;
    }
}
```

The entity class has several annotations that give Hibernate additional information to bind the entity class to the table.

- `@Entity` declares that `PlayerBean` is an entity class.
- `@Table` relates this entity class to the `player_jpa` table using the annotation attribute `name`.
- `@Id` declares that this property is related to the primary key column of the table.
- `@GeneratedValue` indicates that the value of this column is generated automatically and should not be set manually. The attribute `generator` is used to specify the name of the generator as `player_id`.
- `@SequenceGenerator` declares a generator that uses [sequence](/sql-statements/sql-statement-create-sequence.md), and uses the annotation attribute `name` to declare the name of the generator as `player_id` (consistent with the name specified in `@GeneratedValue`). The annotation attribute `sequenceName` is used to specify the name of the sequence in the database. Finally, the annotation attribute `allocationSize` is used to declare the sequence's step size to be 1.
- `@Column` declares each private attribute as a column of the `player_jpa` table, and uses the annotation attribute `name` to determine the name of the column corresponding to the attribute.

#### Repository

To abstract the database layer, Spring applications use the [`Repository`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories) interface, or a sub-interface of the `Repository`. This interface maps to a database object, such as a table. JPA implements some pre-built methods, such as [`INSERT`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-insert.md), or [`SELECT`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-select.md) using the primay key.

```java
package com.pingcap.dao;

import jakarta.persistence.LockModeType;
import org.springframework.data.domain.Page;
import org.springframework.data.domain.Pageable;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Lock;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Query;
import org.springframework.data.repository.query.Param;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

import java.util.List;

@Repository
public interface PlayerRepository extends JpaRepository<PlayerBean, Long> {
    /**
     * use HQL to query by page
     * @param pageable a pageable parameter required by hibernate
     * @return player list package by page message
     */
    @Query(value = "SELECT player_jpa FROM PlayerBean player_jpa")
    Page<PlayerBean> getPlayersByPage(Pageable pageable);

    /**
     * use SQL to query by limit, using named parameter
     * @param limit sql parameter
     * @return player list (max size by limit)
     */
    @Query(value = "SELECT * FROM player_jpa LIMIT :limit", nativeQuery = true)
    List<PlayerBean> getPlayersByLimit(@Param("limit") Integer limit);

    /**
     * query player and add a lock for update
     * @param id player id
     * @return player
     */
    @Lock(value = LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)
    @Query(value = "SELECT player FROM PlayerBean player WHERE player.id = :id")
    // @Query(value = "SELECT * FROM player_jpa WHERE id = :id FOR UPDATE", nativeQuery = true)
    PlayerBean getPlayerAndLock(@Param("id") Long id);
}
```

The `PlayerRepository` interface extends the `JpaRepository` interface used by Spring for JPA data access. The `@Query` annotation is used to tell Hibernate how to implement queries in this interface. Two query syntaxes are used:

* In the `getPlayersByPage` interface, [Hibernate Query Language](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.0/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#hql) (HQL) is used.
* In the `getPlayersByLimit` interface, native SQL is used. When the interface uses the native SQL syntax, the `@Query` annotation parameter `nativeQuery` must be set to `true`.

In the SQL for the `getPlayersByLimit` annotation, `:limit` is called a [named parameter](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.0/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#jpql-query-parameters) in Hibernate. Hibernate automatically finds and splices the parameter by name within the interface where the annotation resides. You can also use `@Param` to specify a name different from the parameter for injection.

In `getPlayerAndLock`, an annotation [`@Lock`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/jpa/repository/Lock.html) is used to declare that pessimistic locking is applied. For details on other locking methods, see [Entity Locking](https://openjpa.apache.org/builds/2.2.2/apache-openjpa/docs/jpa_overview_em_locking.html). The `@Lock` annotation must be used with `HQL`; otherwise, an error occurs. If you want to use SQL directly for locking, you can use the annotation from the comment:

```java
@Query(value = "SELECT * FROM player_jpa WHERE id = :id FOR UPDATE", nativeQuery = true)
```

The SQL statement above uses `FOR UPDATE` to add locks directly. You can also dive deeper into the principles with the TiDB [`SELECT` statement](/sql-statements/sql-statement-select.md).

### Logic implementation

The logic implementation layer is the `service` package, which contains the interfaces and logic implemented by the project.

#### Interface

The `PlayerService.java` file defines the logical interface and implements the interface rather than writing a class directly. This is to keep the example as close to actual use as possible and to reflect the [open-closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle) of the design. You may omit this interface and inject the implementation class directly in the dependency class, but this approach is not recommended.

```java
package com.pingcap.service;

import com.pingcap.dao.PlayerBean;
import org.springframework.data.domain.Page;

import java.util.List;

public interface PlayerService {
    /**
     * create players by passing in a List of PlayerBean
     *
     * @param players will create players list
     * @return The number of create accounts
     */
    Integer createPlayers(List<PlayerBean> players);

    /**
     * buy goods and transfer funds between one player and another in one transaction
     * @param sellId sell player id
     * @param buyId buy player id
     * @param amount goods amount, if sell player has not enough goods, the trade will break
     * @param price price should pay, if buy player has not enough coins, the trade will break
     */
    void buyGoods(Long sellId, Long buyId, Integer amount, Integer price) throws RuntimeException;

    /**
     * get the player info by id.
     *
     * @param id player id
     * @return the player of this id
     */
    PlayerBean getPlayerByID(Long id);

    /**
     * get a subset of players from the data store by limit.
     *
     * @param limit return max size
     * @return player list
     */
    List<PlayerBean> getPlayers(Integer limit);

    /**
     * get a page of players from the data store.
     *
     * @param index page index
     * @param size page size
     * @return player list
     */
    Page<PlayerBean> getPlayersByPage(Integer index, Integer size);

    /**
     * count players from the data store.
     *
     * @return all players count
     */
    Long countPlayers();
}
```

#### Implementation (Important)

The `PlayerService.java` file implements the `PlayerService` interface, which contains all the data processing logic.

```java
package com.pingcap.service.impl;

import com.pingcap.dao.PlayerBean;
import com.pingcap.dao.PlayerRepository;
import com.pingcap.service.PlayerService;
import jakarta.transaction.Transactional;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.data.domain.Page;
import org.springframework.data.domain.PageRequest;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import java.util.List;

/**
 * PlayerServiceImpl implements PlayerService interface
 * @Transactional it means every method in this class, will package by a pair of
 *     transaction.begin() and transaction.commit(). and it will be call
 *     transaction.rollback() when method throw an exception
 */
@Service
@Transactional
public class PlayerServiceImpl implements PlayerService {
    @Autowired
    private PlayerRepository playerRepository;

    @Override
    public Integer createPlayers(List<PlayerBean> players) {
        return playerRepository.saveAll(players).size();
    }

    @Override
    public void buyGoods(Long sellId, Long buyId, Integer amount, Integer price) throws RuntimeException {
        PlayerBean buyPlayer = playerRepository.getPlayerAndLock(buyId);
        PlayerBean sellPlayer = playerRepository.getPlayerAndLock(sellId);
        if (buyPlayer == null || sellPlayer == null) {
            throw new RuntimeException("sell or buy player not exist");
        }

        if (buyPlayer.getCoins() < price || sellPlayer.getGoods() < amount) {
            throw new RuntimeException("coins or goods not enough, rollback");
        }

        buyPlayer.setGoods(buyPlayer.getGoods() + amount);
        buyPlayer.setCoins(buyPlayer.getCoins() - price);
        playerRepository.save(buyPlayer);

        sellPlayer.setGoods(sellPlayer.getGoods() - amount);
        sellPlayer.setCoins(sellPlayer.getCoins() + price);
        playerRepository.save(sellPlayer);
    }

    @Override
    public PlayerBean getPlayerByID(Long id) {
        return playerRepository.findById(id).orElse(null);
    }

    @Override
    public List<PlayerBean> getPlayers(Integer limit) {
        return playerRepository.getPlayersByLimit(limit);
    }

    @Override
    public Page<PlayerBean> getPlayersByPage(Integer index, Integer size) {
        return playerRepository.getPlayersByPage(PageRequest.of(index, size));
    }

    @Override
    public Long countPlayers() {
        return playerRepository.count();
    }
}
```

The `@Service` annotation is used to declare that the lifecycle of this object is managed by `Spring`.

The `PlayerServiceImpl` implementation class also has a [`@Transactional`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/data-access.html#transaction-declarative-annotations) annotation in addition to the `@Service` annotation. When transaction management is enabled in the application (which can be turned on using [`@EnableTransactionManagement`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/annotation/EnableTransactionManagement.html), but is turned on by default by `Spring Boot`. You don not need to manually configure it.), `Spring` automatically wraps all objects with the `@Transactional` annotation in a proxy and uses this proxy for object invocation processing.

You can simply assume that when the agent calls a function inside an object with the `@Transactional` annotation:

- At the top of the function, it starts the transaction with `transaction.begin()`.
- When the function returns, it calls `transaction.commit()` to commit the transaction.
- When any runtime error occurs, the agent calls `transaction.rollback()` to roll back.

You can refer to [Database Transactions](/develop/dev-guide-transaction-overview.md) for more information on transactions, or read [Understanding the Spring Framework's Declarative Transaction Implementation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/data-access.html#tx-decl-explained) on the `Spring` website.

In all implementation classes, the `buyGoods` function is requires attention. When the function encounters an illogical operation, it throws an exception and directs Hibernate to perform a transaction rollback to prevent incorrect data.

### External HTTP Interface

The `controller` package exposes the HTTP interface to the outside world and allows access to the service via the [REST API](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api#).

```java
package com.pingcap.controller;

import com.pingcap.dao.PlayerBean;
import com.pingcap.service.PlayerService;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.data.domain.Page;
import org.springframework.lang.NonNull;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import java.util.List;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/player")
public class PlayerController {
    @Autowired
    private PlayerService playerService;

    @PostMapping
    public Integer createPlayer(@RequestBody @NonNull List<PlayerBean> playerList) {
        return playerService.createPlayers(playerList);
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public PlayerBean getPlayerByID(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return playerService.getPlayerByID(id);
    }

    @GetMapping("/limit/{limit_size}")
    public List<PlayerBean> getPlayerByLimit(@PathVariable("limit_size") Integer limit) {
        return playerService.getPlayers(limit);
    }

    @GetMapping("/page")
    public Page<PlayerBean> getPlayerByPage(@RequestParam Integer index, @RequestParam("size") Integer size) {
        return playerService.getPlayersByPage(index, size);
    }

    @GetMapping("/count")
    public Long getPlayersCount() {
        return playerService.countPlayers();
    }

    @PutMapping("/trade")
    public Boolean trade(@RequestParam Long sellID, @RequestParam Long buyID, @RequestParam Integer amount, @RequestParam Integer price) {
        try {
            playerService.buyGoods(sellID, buyID, amount, price);
        } catch (RuntimeException e) {
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

`PlayerController` uses annotations as many as possible to demonstrate features. In real projects, keep the style consistent while following the rules of your company or team. The annotations in `PlayerController` are explained as follows:

- [`@RestController`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RestController.html) declares `PlayerController` as a [Web Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) and serializes the return value as `JSON` output.
- [`@RequestMapping`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RequestMapping.html) maps the URL endpoint to `/player`, that is, this `Web Controller` only listens for requests sent to the `/player` URL.
- `@Autowired` means `Spring` container can autowire relationships between collaborating beans. The declaration requires a `PlayerService` object, which is an interface and does not specify which implementation class to use. This is assembled by Spring. For the rules of this assembly, see [The IoC container](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html) on Spring's official website.
- [`@PostMapping`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/PostMapping.html) declares that this function responds to a [POST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) request in HTTP.
    - `@RequestBody` declares that the entire HTTP payload is parsed into the `playerList` parameter.
    - `@NonNull` declares that the parameter must not be null; otherwise, it returns an error.
- [`@GetMapping`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/GetMapping.html) declares that this function responds to a [GET](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) request in HTTP.
    - [`@PathVariable`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/PathVariable.html) shows that the annotation has placeholders like `{id}` and `{limit_size}`, which are bound to the variable annotated by `@PathVariable`. Such binding is based on the annotation attribute `name`. If the annotation attribute `name` is not specified, it is the same as the variable name. The variable name can be omitted, that is, `@PathVariable(name="limit_size")` can be written as `@PathVariable("limit_size")`.
- [`@PutMapping`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/PutMapping.html) declares that this function responds to a [PUT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT) request in HTTP.
- [`@RequestParam`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RequestParam.html) declares that this function parses URL parameters, form parameters, and other parameters in the request and binds them to the annotated variables.

## Create a blank application with the same dependency (optional)

This application is built using [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/). You can quickly get a blank application with the same dependencies as this sample application by clicking on the following options and changing a few configuration items:

- Java

**Spring Boot**

- Latest stable version

**Project Metadata**

- Group: com.pingcap
- Artifact: spring-jpa-hibernate
- Name: spring-jpa-hibernate
- Package name: com.pingcap
- Packaging: Jar
- Java: 17

**Dependencies**

- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL Driver

The complete configuration is as follows:

![Spring Initializr Configuration](/media/develop/develop-spring-initializr-configuration.png)

> **Note:**
>
> Although SQL is relatively standardized, each database vendor uses a subset and superset of ANSI SQL defined syntax. This is referred to as the database's dialect. Hibernate handles variations across these dialects through its `org.hibernate.dialect.Dialect` class and the various subclasses for each database vendor.
>
> In most cases, Hibernate will be able to determine the proper Dialect to use by asking some questions of the JDBC Connection during bootstrap. For information on Hibernate's ability to determine the proper Dialect to use (and your ability to influence that resolution), see [Dialect resolution](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.0/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#portability-dialectresolver).
>
> If for some reason it is not able to determine the proper one or you want to use a custom Dialect, you will need to set the `hibernate.dialect` setting.
>
> _—— Excerpt from the Hibernate official documentation: [Database Dialect](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.0/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#database-dialect)_

After the configuration, you can get a blank **Spring Boot** application with the same dependencies as the sample application.
