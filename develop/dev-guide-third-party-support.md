# Third-Party Tools Supported by TiDB

> **Note:**
>
> This document only lists common [third-party tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_source) supported by TiDB. Some other third-party tools are not listed, not because they are not supported, but because PingCAP is not sure whether they use features that are incompatible with TiDB.

TiDB is [highly compatible with the MySQL protocol](/mysql-compatibility.md), so most of the MySQL drivers, ORM frameworks, and other tools that adapt to MySQL are compatible with TiDB. This document focuses on these tools and their support levels for TiDB.

## Support Level

PingCAP works with the community and provides the following support levels for third-party tools:

- **_Full_**: Indicates that TiDB is already compatible with most functionalities of the corresponding third-party tool, and maintains compatibility with its newer versions. PingCAP will periodically conduct compatibility tests with the latest version of the tool.
- **_Compatible_**: Indicates that because the corresponding third-party tool is adapted to MySQL and TiDB is highly compatible with the MySQL protocol, so TiDB can use most features of the tool. However, PingCAP has not completed a full test on all features of the tool, which might lead to some unexpected behaviors.

> **Note:**
>
> Unless specified, support for [Application retry and error handling](/develop/dev-guide-transaction-troubleshoot.md#application-retry-and-error-handling) is not included for **Driver** or **ORM frameworks**.

If you encounter problems when connecting to TiDB using the tools listed in this document, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%2Fquestion&template=general-question.md) on GitHub with details to promote support on this tool.
