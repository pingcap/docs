# Connect to TiDB with Go-MySQL-Driver

TiDB is a MySQL-compatible database, and [Go-MySQL-Driver](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql) is a MySQL implementation for the [database/sql](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql) interface.

In this tutorial, you can learn how to use TiDB and Go-MySQL-Driver to accomplish the following tasks:

- Set up your environment.
- Connect to your TiDB cluster using Go-MySQL-Driver.
- Build and run your application. Optionally, you can find [sample code snippets](#sample-code-snippets) for basic CRUD operations.

> **Note:**
>
> This tutorial works with TiDB Serverless, TiDB Dedicated, and TiDB Self-Hosted.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need:

- [Go](https://go.dev/) **1.20** or higher.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- A TiDB cluster.

<CustomContent platform="tidb">

**If you don't have a TiDB cluster, you can create one as follows:**

- (Recommended) Follow [Creating a TiDB Serverless cluster](/develop/dev-guide-build-cluster-in-cloud.md) to create your own TiDB Cloud cluster.
- Follow [Deploy a local test TiDB cluster](/quick-start-with-tidb.md#deploy-a-local-test-cluster) or [Deploy a production TiDB cluster](/production-deployment-using-tiup.md) to create a local cluster.

## Run the sample app to connect to TiDB

This section demonstrates how to run the sample application code and connect to TiDB.

### Step 1: Clone the sample app repository

Run the following commands in your terminal window to clone the sample code repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tidb-samples/tidb-golang-sql-driver-quickstart.git
cd tidb-golang-sql-driver-quickstart
```

### Step 2: Configure connection information

Connect to your TiDB cluster depending on the TiDB deployment option you've selected.

<SimpleTab>
<div label="TiDB Serverless">

1. Navigate to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page, and then click the name of your target cluster to go to its overview page.

2. Click **Connect** in the upper-right corner. A connection dialog is displayed.

3. Ensure the configurations in the connection dialog match your operating environment.

    - **Endpoint Type** is set to `Public`
    - **Branch** is set to `main`
    - **Connect With** is set to `General`
    - **Operating System** matches your environment.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > If your program is running in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), switch to the corresponding Linux distribution.

4. Click **Generate Password** to create a random password.

    > **Tip:**
    > 
    > If you have created a password before, you can either use the original password or click **Reset Password** to generate a new one.

5. Run the following command to copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`:

    ```shell
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

6. Copy and paste the corresponding connection string into the `.env` file. The example result is as follows:

    ```dotenv
    TIDB_HOST='{host}'  # e.g. gateway01.ap-northeast-1.prod.aws.tidbcloud.com
    TIDB_PORT='4000'
    TIDB_USER='{user}'  # e.g. xxxxxx.root
    TIDB_PASSWORD='{password}'
    TIDB_DB_NAME='test'
    USE_SSL='true'
    ```

    Be sure to replace the placeholders `{}` with the connection parameters obtained from the connection dialog.

    TiDB Serverless requires a secure connection. Therefore, you need to set the value of `USE_SSL` to `true`.

7. Save the `.env` file.

</div>
<div label="TiDB Dedicated">

1. Navigate to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page, and then click the name of your target cluster to go to its overview page.

2. Click **Connect** in the upper-right corner. A connection dialog is displayed.

3. Click **Allow Access from Anywhere** and then click **Download CA cert** to download the CA certificate.

    For more details about how to obtain the connection string, refer to [TiDB Dedicated standard connection](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/connect-via-standard-connection).

4. Run the following command to copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`:

    ```shell
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5. Copy and paste the corresponding connection string into the `.env` file. The example result is as follows:

    ```dotenv
    TIDB_HOST='{host}'  # e.g. tidb.xxxx.clusters.tidb-cloud.com
    TIDB_PORT='4000'
    TIDB_USER='{user}'  # e.g. root
    TIDB_PASSWORD='{password}'
    TIDB_DB_NAME='test'
    USE_SSL='false'
    ```

    Be sure to replace the placeholders `{}` with the connection parameters obtained from the connection dialog.

6. Save the `.env` file.

</div>
<div label="TiDB Self-Hosted">

1. Run the following command to copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`:

    ```shell
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2. Copy and paste the corresponding connection string into the `.env` file. The example result is as follows:

    ```dotenv
    TIDB_HOST='{host}'
    TIDB_PORT='4000'
    TIDB_USER='root'
    TIDB_PASSWORD='{password}'
    TIDB_DB_NAME='test'
    USE_SSL='false'
    ```

    Be sure to replace the placeholders `{}` with the connection parameters, and set `USE_SSL` to `false`. If you are running TiDB locally, the default host address is `127.0.0.1`, and the password is empty.

3. Save the `.env` file.

</div>
</SimpleTab>

### Step 3: Run the code and check the result

1. Execute the following command to run the sample code:

    ```shell
    make
    ```

2. Check the [Expected-Output.txt](https://github.com/tidb-samples/tidb-golang-sql-driver-quickstart/blob/main/Expected-Output.txt) to see if the output matches.

## Sample code snippets

You can refer to the following sample code snippets to complete your own application development.

For complete sample code and how to run it, check out the [tidb-samples/tidb-golang-sql-driver-quickstart](https://github.com/tidb-samples/tidb-golang-sql-driver-quickstart) repository.

### Connect to TiDB

```golang
func openDB(driverName string, runnable func(db *sql.DB)) {
    dsn := fmt.Sprintf("%s:%s@tcp(%s:%s)/%s?charset=utf8mb4&tls=%s",
        ${tidb_user}, ${tidb_password}, ${tidb_host}, ${tidb_port}, ${tidb_db_name}, ${use_ssl})
    db, err := sql.Open(driverName, dsn)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer db.Close()

    runnable(db)
}
```

When using this function, you need to replace `${tidb_host}`, `${tidb_port}`, `${tidb_user}`, `${tidb_password}`, and `${tidb_db_name}` with the actual values of your TiDB cluster. TiDB Serverless requires a secure connection. Therefore, you need to set the value of `${use_ssl}` to `true`.

### Insert data

```golang
openDB("mysql", func(db *sql.DB) {
    insertSQL = "INSERT INTO player (id, coins, goods) VALUES (?, ?, ?)"
    _, err := db.Exec(insertSQL, "id", 1, 1)

    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
})
```

For more information, refer to [Insert data](/develop/dev-guide-insert-data.md).

### Query data

```golang
openDB("mysql", func(db *sql.DB) {
    selectSQL = "SELECT id, coins, goods FROM player WHERE id = ?"
    rows, err := db.Query(selectSQL, "id")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // This line is extremely important!
    defer rows.Close()

    id, coins, goods := "", 0, 0
    if rows.Next() {
        err = rows.Scan(&id, &coins, &goods)
        if err == nil {
            fmt.Printf("player id: %s, coins: %d, goods: %d\n", id, coins, goods)
        }
    }
})
```

For more information, refer to [Query data](/develop/dev-guide-get-data-from-single-table.md).

### Update data

```golang
openDB("mysql", func(db *sql.DB) {
    updateSQL = "UPDATE player set goods = goods + ?, coins = coins + ? WHERE id = ?"
    _, err := db.Exec(updateSQL, 1, -1, "id")

    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
})
```

For more information, refer to [Update data](/develop/dev-guide-update-data.md).

### Delete data

```golang
openDB("mysql", func(db *sql.DB) {
    deleteSQL = "DELETE FROM player WHERE id=?"
    _, err := db.Exec(deleteSQL, "id")

    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
})
```

For more information, refer to [Delete data](/develop/dev-guide-delete-data.md).

## Useful notes

### Using driver or ORM framework?

The Golang driver provides low-level access to the database, but it requires the developers to:

- Manually establish and release database connections.
- Manually manage database transactions.
- Manually map data rows to data objects.

Unless you need to write complex SQL statements, it is recommended to use [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Object-relational_mapping) framework for development, such as [GORM](/develop/dev-guide-sample-application-golang-gorm.md). It can help you:

- Reduce [boilerplate code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code) for managing connections and transactions.
- Manipulate data with data objects instead of a number of SQL statements.
