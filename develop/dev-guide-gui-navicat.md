# Connect to TiDB with Navicat

TiDB is a MySQL-compatible database, and [Navicat](https://www.navicat.com) is a GUI tool set for database users. This tutorial uses the [Navicat for MySQL](https://www.navicat.com/en/products/navicat-for-mysql) tool to connect to TiDB.

> **Warning:**
>
> - Although you can use Navicat to connect to TiDB due to its MySQL compatibility, Navicat does not fully support TiDB. You might encounter some issues during usage as it treats TiDB as MySQL. There is a known issue about [Navicat user management compatibility](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/45154). For more compatibility issues between Navicat and TiDB, see the [TiDB GitHub issue page](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+navicat+is%3Aopen).
> - It is recommended to use other GUI tools that officially support TiDB, such as [DataGrip](/develop/dev-guide-gui-datagrip.md), [DBeaver](/develop/dev-guide-gui-dbeaver.md), and [VS Code SQLTools](/develop/dev-guide-gui-vscode-sqltools.md). For a complete list of GUI tools that fully supported by TiDB, see [Third-party tools supported by TiDB](/develop/dev-guide-third-party-support.md#gui).

In this tutorial, you can learn how to connect to your TiDB cluster using Navicat.

> **Note:**
>
> This tutorial is compatible with TiDB Serverless, TiDB Dedicated, and TiDB Self-Hosted.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need:

- [Navicat for MySQL](https://www.navicat.com/en/download/navicat-for-mysql) **16.3.2** or later versions.
- A paid account for Navicat for MySQL.
- A TiDB cluster.

**If you don't have a TiDB cluster, you can create one as follows:**

- (Recommended) Follow [Creating a TiDB Serverless cluster](/develop/dev-guide-build-cluster-in-cloud.md) to create your own TiDB Cloud cluster.
- Follow [Deploy a local test TiDB cluster](/quick-start-with-tidb.md#deploy-a-local-test-cluster) or [Deploy a production TiDB cluster](/production-deployment-using-tiup.md) to create a local cluster.

## Connect to TiDB

Connect to your TiDB cluster depending on the TiDB deployment option you have selected.

<SimpleTab>
<div label="TiDB Serverless">

1. Navigate to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page, and then click the name of your target cluster to go to its overview page.

2. Click **Connect** in the upper-right corner. A connection dialog is displayed.

3. Ensure the configurations in the connection dialog match your operating environment.

    - **Endpoint Type** is set to `Public`.
    - **Branch** is set to `main`.
    - **Connect With** is set to `Navicat`.
    - **Operating System** matches your environment.

4. Click **Generate Password** to create a random password.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > If you have created a password before, you can either use the original password or click **Reset Password** to generate a new one.

5. Launch Navicat for MySQL, click **Connection** in the upper-left corner, and select **MySQL** from the drop-down list.

6. In the **New Connection (MySQL)** dialog, configure the following connection parameters:

    - **Connection Name**: give this connection a meaningful name.
    - **Host**: enter the `HOST` parameter from the TiDB Cloud connection dialog.
    - **Port**: enter the `PORT` parameter from the TiDB Cloud connection dialog.
    - **User Name**: enter the `USERNAME` parameter from the TiDB Cloud connection dialog.
    - **Password**: enter the password of the TiDB Serverless cluster.
