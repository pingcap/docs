# Build a Simple CRUD App with TiDB and Python

This document describes how to use TiDB and Python to build a simple CRUD application.

> **Note:**
>
> It is recommended to use Python 3.10 or a later Python version.

## Step 1. Launch your TiDB cluster

<CustomContent platform="tidb">

The following introduces how to start a TiDB cluster.

**Use a TiDB Cloud Serverless Tier cluster**

For detailed steps, see [Create a Serverless Tier cluster](/develop/dev-guide-build-cluster-in-cloud.md#step-1-create-a-serverless-tier-cluster).

**Use a local cluster**

For detailed steps, see [Deploy a local test cluster](/quick-start-with-tidb.md#deploy-a-local-test-cluster) or [Deploy a TiDB cluster using TiUP](/production-deployment-using-tiup.md).

<CustomContent platform="tidb-cloud">

See [Create a Serverless Tier cluster](/develop/dev-guide-build-cluster-in-cloud.md#step-1-create-a-serverless-tier-cluster).

## Step 2. Get the code

```shell
git clone https://github.com/pingcap-inc/tidb-example-python.git

[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is a popular open-source ORM library for Python. The following uses SQLAlchemy 1.44 as an example.

Compared with using drivers directly, SQLAlchemy provides an abstraction for the specific details of different databases when you create a database connection. In addition, SQLAlchemy encapsulates some operations such as session management and CRUD of basic objects, which greatly simplifies the code.

The `Player` class is a mapping of a table to attributes in the application. Each attribute of `Player` corresponds to a field in the `player` table. To provide SQLAlchemy with more information, the attribute is defined as `id = Column(String(36), primary_key=True)` to indicate the field type and its additional attributes. For example, `id = Column(String(36), primary_key=True)` indicates that the `id` attribute is `String` type, the corresponding field in database is `VARCHAR` type, the length is `36`, and it is a primary key.

For more information about how to use SQLAlchemy, refer to [SQLAlchemy documentation](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/).

The driver has a lower level of encapsulation than ORM, so there are a lot of SQL statements in the program. Unlike ORM, there is no data object in drivers, so the `Player` queried by the driver is represented as a tuple.

The driver has a lower level of encapsulation than ORM, so there are a lot of SQL statements in the program. Unlike ORM, there is no data object in drivers, so the `Player` queried by the driver is represented as a dictionary.

[mysql-connector-python](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/) is a popular open-source driver for Python. The following uses mysql-connector-python 8.0.31 as an example. Drivers for Python are more convenient to use than other languages, but they do not shield the underlying implementation and require manual management of transactions. If there are not a lot of scenarios where SQL is required, it is recommended to use ORM, which can help reduce the coupling of your program.

## Step 3. Run the code

The following content introduces how to run the code step by step.

### Step 3.1 Initialize table

Before running the code, you need to initialize the table manually. If you are using a local TiDB cluster, you can run the following command:

<SimpleTab groupId="cli">

<div label="MySQL CLI" value="mysql-client">

```shell
mysql --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4000 -u root < player_init.sql
```

</div>

<div label="MyCLI" value="mycli">

```shell
mycli --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4000 -u root --no-warn < player_init.sql
```

</div>

</SimpleTab>

If you are not using a local cluster, or have not installed a MySQL client, connect to your cluster using your preferred method (such as Navicat, DBeaver, or other GUI tools) and run the SQL statements in the `player_init.sql` file.

### Step 3.2 Modify parameters for TiDB Cloud

If you are using a TiDB Cloud Serverless Tier cluster, you need to provide your CA root path and replace `<ca_path>` in the following examples with your CA path. To get the CA root path on your system, refer to [Where is the CA root path on my system?](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/secure-connections-to-serverless-tier-clusters#where-is-the-ca-root-path-on-my-system).

<SimpleTab groupId="language">

<div label="SQLAlchemy (Recommended)" value="SQLAlchemy">

If you are using a TiDB Cloud Serverless Tier cluster, modify the parameters of the `create_engine` function in `sqlalchemy_example.py`:

```python
engine = create_engine('mysql://root:@127.0.0.1:4000/test')
```

Suppose that the password you set is `123456`, and the connection parameters you get from the cluster details page are the following:

- Endpoint: `xxx.tidbcloud.com`
- Port: `4000`
- User: `2aEp24QWEDLqRFs.root`

In this case, you can modify the `create_engine` as follows:

```python
engine = create_engine('mysql://2aEp24QWEDLqRFs.root:123456@xxx.tidbcloud.com:4000/test', connect_args={
    "ssl_mode": "VERIFY_IDENTITY",
    "ssl": {
        "ca": "<ca_path>"
    }
})
```

</div>

<div label="peewee (Recommended)" value="peewee">

If you are using a TiDB Cloud Serverless Tier cluster, modify the parameters of the `create_engine` function in `sqlalchemy_example.py`:

```python
db = connect('mysql://root:@127.0.0.1:4000/test')
```

Suppose that the password you set is `123456`, and the connection parameters you get from the cluster details page are the following:

- Endpoint: `xxx.tidbcloud.com`
- Port: `4000`
- User: `2aEp24QWEDLqRFs.root`

In this case, you can modify the `connect` as follows:

- When peewee uses PyMySQL as the driver:

    ```python
    db = connect('mysql://2aEp24QWEDLqRFs.root:123456@xxx.tidbcloud.com:4000/test', 
        ssl_verify_cert=True, ssl_ca="<ca_path>")
    ```

- When peewee uses mysqlclient as the driver:

    ```python
    db = connect('mysql://2aEp24QWEDLqRFs.root:123456@xxx.tidbcloud.com:4000/test',
        ssl_mode="VERIFY_IDENTITY", ssl={"ca": "<ca_path>"})
    ```

Because peewee will pass parameters to the driver, you need to pay attention to the usage type of the driver when using peewee.

</div>

<div label="mysqlclient" value="mysqlclient">

If you are using a TiDB Cloud Serverless Tier cluster, change the `get_connection` function in `mysqlclient_example.py`:

```python
def get_connection(autocommit: bool = True) -> MySQLdb.Connection:
    return MySQLdb.connect(
        host="127.0.0.1",
        port=4000,
        user="root",
        password="",
        database="test",
        autocommit=autocommit
    )
```

Suppose that the password you set is `123456`, and the connection parameters you get from the cluster details page are the following:

- Endpoint: `xxx.tidbcloud.com`
- Port: `4000`
- User: `2aEp24QWEDLqRFs.root`

In this case, you can modify the `get_connection` as follows:

```python
def get_connection(autocommit: bool = True) -> MySQLdb.Connection:
    return MySQLdb.connect(
        host="xxx.tidbcloud.com",
