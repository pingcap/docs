# Key Monitoring Metrics of TiKV

If you use TiUP or TiDB Ansible to deploy the TiDB cluster, the monitoring system (Prometheus/Grafana) is deployed at the same time. For more information, see [Overview of the Monitoring Framework](/tidb-monitoring-framework.md).

The Grafana dashboard is divided into a series of sub dashboards which include Overview, PD, TiDB, TiKV, Node\_exporter, and so on. A lot of metrics are there to help you diagnose.

You can get an overview of the component TiKV status from the **TiKV-Details** dashboard, where the key metrics are displayed. According to the [Performance Map](https://asktug.com/_/tidb-performance-map/#/), you can check whether the status of the cluster is as expected.

This document provides a detailed description of these key metrics on the **TiKV-Details** dashboard.
