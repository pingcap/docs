# TiKV Configuration Flags

TiKV supports some readable unit conversions for command line parameters.

- File size (based on byte): KB, MB, GB, TB, PB (or lowercase)
- Time (based on ms): ms, s, m, h

## `-A, --addr`

- The address that the TiKV server monitors
- Default: "127.0.0.1:20160"
- To deploy a cluster, you must use `--addr` to specify the IP address of the current host, such as "192.168.100.113:20160". If the cluster is run on Docker, specify the IP address of Docker as "0.0.0.0:20160".

## `--advertise-addr`

- The server advertise address for client traffic from outside
- Default: ${addr}
- If the client cannot connect to TiKV through the `--addr` address because of Docker or NAT network, you must manually set the `--advertise-addr` address.
- For example, the internal IP address of Docker is 172.17.0.1, while the IP address of the host is 192.168.100.113 and the port mapping is set to `-p 20160:20160`. In this case, you can set `--advertise-addr` to "192.168.100.113:20160". The client can find this service through 192.168.100.113:20160.

## `--status-addr`

+ The port through which the TiKV service status is listened
+ Default: "20180"
+ The Prometheus can access this status information via `http://host:status_port/metrics`.
+ The Profile can access this status information via `http://host:status_port/debug/pprof/profile`.

## `--advertise-status-addr`

- The address through which TiKV accesses service status from outside.
- Default: The value of `--status-addr` is used.
- If the client cannot connect to TiKV through the `--status-addr` address because of Docker or NAT network, you must manually set the `--advertise-status-addr` address.
- For example, the internal IP address of Docker is `172.17.0.1`, while the IP address of the host is `192.168.100.113` and the port mapping is set to `-p 20180:20180`. In this case, set `\-\-advertise-status-addr="192.168.100.113:20180"`. The client can find this service through `192.168.100.113:20180`.

## `-C, --config`

- The config file
- Default: ""
- If you set the configuration using the command line, the same setting in the config file will be overwritten.

## `--capacity`

- The store capacity
- Default: 0 (unlimited)
- PD uses this flag to determine how to balance the TiKV servers. (Tip: you can use 10GB instead of 1073741824)

## `--data-dir`

- The path to the data directory
- Default: "/tmp/tikv/store"

## `-L, --Log`

- The log level
- Default: "info"
- You can choose from trace, debug, info, warn, error, or off.

## `--log-file`

- The log file
- Default: ""
- If this flag is not set, logs will be written to stderr. Otherwise, logs will be stored in the log file which will be automatically rotated every day.

## `--pd`

- The address list of PD servers
- Default: ""
- To make TiKV work, you must use the value of `--pd` to connect the TiKV server to the PD server. Separate multiple PD addresses using comma, for example "192.168.100.113:2379, 192.168.100.114:2379, 192.168.100.115:2379".
