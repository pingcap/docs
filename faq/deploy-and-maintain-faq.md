# Deployment, Operations and Maintenance FAQs

This document summarizes the FAQs related to TiDB deployment, operations and maintenance.

## Operating system requirements

### What are the required operating system versions?

| Linux OS Platform        | Version      |
| :-----------------------:| :----------: |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux | 7.3 or later |
| CentOS                   | 7.3 or later |
| Oracle Enterprise Linux  | 7.3 or later |

### Why it is recommended to deploy the TiDB cluster on CentOS 7?

As an open source distributed NewSQL database with high performance, TiDB can be deployed in the Intel architecture server and major virtualization environments and runs well. TiDB supports most of the major hardware networks and Linux operating systems. For details, see [Official Deployment Requirements](/hardware-and-software-requirements.md) for deploying TiDB.

A lot of TiDB tests have been carried out in CentOS 7.3, and many deployment best practices have been accumulated in CentOS 7.3. Therefore, it is recommended that you use the CentOS 7.3+ Linux operating system when deploying TiDB.

## Server requirements

You can deploy and run TiDB on the 64-bit generic hardware server platform in the Intel x86-64 architecture. The requirements and recommendations about server hardware configuration for development, testing and production environments are as follows:

### Development and testing environments

| Component | CPU | Memory | Local Storage  | Network  | Instance Number (Minimum Requirement) |
| :------: | :-----: | :-----: | :----------: | :------: | :----------------: |
| TiDB    | 8 core+   | 16 GB+  | SAS, 200 GB+ | Gigabit network card | 1 (can be deployed on the same machine with PD)      |
| PD      | 8 core+   | 16 GB+  | SAS, 200 GB+ | Gigabit network card | 1 (can be deployed on the same machine with TiDB)       |
| TiKV    | 8 core+   | 32 GB+  | SAS, 200 GB+ | Gigabit network card | 3  |
|         |         |         |              | Total Server Number |  4  |

### Production environment

| Component | CPU | Memory | Hard Disk Type | Network | Instance Number (Minimum Requirement) |
| :-----: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :-----: |
|  TiDB  | 16 core+ | 48 GB+ | SAS | 10 Gigabit network card (2 preferred) | 2 |
| PD | 8 core+ | 16 GB+ | SSD | 10 Gigabit network card (2 preferred) | 3 |
| TiKV | 16 core+ | 48 GB+ | SSD | 10 Gigabit network card (2 preferred) | 3 |
| Monitor | 8 core+ | 16 GB+ | SAS | Gigabit network card | 1 |
|     |     |     |      |  Total Server Number   |    9   |

### What's the purposes of 2 network cards of 10 gigabit?

As a distributed cluster, TiDB has a high demand on time, especially for PD, because PD needs to distribute unique timestamps. If the time in the PD servers is not consistent, it takes longer waiting time when switching the PD server. The bond of two network cards guarantees the stability of data transmission, and 10 gigabit guarantees the transmission speed. Gigabit network cards are prone to meet bottlenecks, therefore it is strongly recommended to use 10 gigabit network cards.

### Is it feasible if we don't use RAID for SSD?

If the resources are adequate, it is recommended to use RAID 10 for SSD. If the resources are inadequate, it is acceptable not to use RAID for SSD.

### What's the recommended configuration of TiDB components?

- TiDB has a high requirement on CPU and memory. If you need to enable TiDB Binlog, the local disk space should be increased based on the service volume estimation and the time requirement for the GC operation. But the SSD disk is not a must.
- PD stores the cluster metadata and has frequent Read and Write requests. It demands a high I/O disk. A disk of low performance will affect the performance of the whole cluster. It is recommended to use SSD disks. In addition, a larger number of Regions has a higher requirement on CPU and memory.
- TiKV has a high requirement on CPU, memory and disk. It is required to use SSD.

For details, see [Software and Hardware Recommendations](/hardware-and-software-requirements.md).

## Installation and deployment

For the production environment, it is recommended to use [TiUP](/tiup/tiup-overview.md) to deploy your TiDB cluster. See [Deploy a TiDB Cluster Using TiUP](/production-deployment-using-tiup.md).

### Why the modified `toml` configuration for TiKV/PD does not take effect?

You need to set the `--config` parameter in TiKV/PD to make the `toml` configuration effective. TiKV/PD does not read the configuration by default. Currently, this issue only occurs when deploying using Binary. For TiKV, edit the configuration and restart the service. For PD, the configuration file is only read when PD is started for the first time, after which you can modify the configuration using pd-ctl. For details, see [PD Control User Guide](/pd-control.md).

### Should I deploy the TiDB monitoring framework (Prometheus + Grafana) on a standalone machine or on multiple machines? What is the recommended CPU and memory?

The monitoring machine is recommended to use standalone deployment. It is recommended to use an 8 core CPU with 16 GB+ memory and a 500 GB+ hard disk.

### Why the monitor cannot display all metrics?

Check the time difference between the machine time of the monitor and the time within the cluster. If it is large, you can correct the time and the monitor will display all the metrics.

### What is the function of supervise/svc/svstat service?

- supervise: the daemon process, to manage the processes
- svc: to start and stop the service
- svstat: to check the process status

### Description of inventory.ini variables

| Variable        | Description                                                |
| ---- | ------- |
| `cluster_name` | the name of a cluster, adjustable |
| `tidb_version` | the version of TiDB, configured by default in TiDB Ansible branches |
| `deployment_method` | the method of deployment, binary by default, Docker optional |
| `process_supervision` | the supervision way of processes, systemd by default, supervise optional |
| `timezone` | the timezone of the managed node, adjustable, `Asia/Shanghai` by default, used with the `set_timezone` variable |
| `set_timezone` | to edit the timezone of the managed node, True by default; False means closing |
| `enable_elk` | currently not supported |
| `enable_firewalld` | to enable the firewall, closed by default |
| `enable_ntpd` | to monitor the NTP service of the managed node, True by default; do not close it |
| `machine_benchmark` | to monitor the disk IOPS of the managed node, True by default; do not close it |
| `set_hostname` | to edit the hostname of the managed node based on the IP, False by default |
| `enable_binlog` | whether to deploy Pump and enable the binlog, False by default, dependent on the Kafka cluster; see the `zookeeper_addrs` variable |
| `zookeeper_addrs` | the ZooKeeper address of the binlog Kafka cluster |
| `enable_slow_query_log` | to record the slow query log of TiDB into a single file: ({{ deploy_dir }}/log/tidb_slow_query.log). False by default, to record it into the TiDB log |
| `deploy_without_tidb` | the Key-Value mode, deploy only PD, TiKV and the monitoring service, not TiDB; set the IP of the tidb_servers host group to null in the `inventory.ini` file |

### Deploy TiDB offline using TiDB Ansibleï¼ˆnot recommended since TiDB v4.0)

> **Warning:**
>
> It is not recommended to deploy TiDB using TiDB Ansible since TiDB v4.0. [Use TiUP to deploy TiDB](/production-deployment-using-tiup.md) instead.

If the central control machine cannot access the Internet, you can [deploy TiDB offline using TiDB Ansible](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/offline-deployment-using-ansible).

### How to deploy TiDB quickly using Docker Compose on a single machine?

You can use Docker Compose to build a TiDB cluster locally, including the cluster monitoring components. You can also customize the version and number of instances for each component. The configuration file can also be customized. You can only use this deployment method for testing and development environment. For details, see [TiDB Docker Compose Deployment](/deploy-test-cluster-using-docker-compose.md).

### How to separately record the slow query log in TiDB? How to locate the slow query SQL statement?

1. The slow query definition for TiDB is in the `conf/tidb.yml` configuration file of `tidb-ansible`. The `slow-threshold: 300` parameter is used to configure the threshold value of the slow query (unit: millisecond).

    The slow query log is recorded in `tidb.log` by default. If you want to generate a slow query log file separately, set `enable_slow_query_log` in the `inventory.ini` configuration file to `True`.

    Then run `ansible-playbook rolling_update.yml --tags=tidb` to perform a rolling update on the `tidb-server` instance. After the update is finished, the `tidb-server` instance will record the slow query log in `tidb_slow_query.log`.

2. If a slow query occurs, you can locate the `tidb-server` instance where the slow query is and the slow query time point using Grafana and find the SQL statement information recorded in the log on the corresponding node.

3. In addition to the log, you can also view the slow query using the `admin show slow` command. For details, see [`admin show slow` command](/identify-slow-queries.md#admin-show-slow-command).

### How to add the `label` configuration if `label` of TiKV was not configured when I deployed the TiDB cluster for the first time?

The configuration of TiDB `label` is related to the cluster deployment architecture. It is important and is the basis for PD to execute global management and scheduling. If you did not configure `label` when deploying the cluster previously, you should adjust the deployment structure by manually adding the `location-labels` information using the PD management tool `pd-ctl`, for example, `config set location-labels "zone,rack,host"` (you should configure it based on the practical `label` level name).

For the usage of `pd-ctl`, see [PD Control User Guide](/pd-control.md).

### Why does the `dd` command for the disk test use the `oflag=direct` option?

The Direct mode wraps the Write request into the I/O command and sends this command to the disk to bypass the file system cache and directly test the real I/O Read/Write performance of the disk.

### How to use the `fio` command to test the disk performance of the TiKV instance?

- Random Read test:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```bash
    ./fio -ioengine=psync -bs=32k -fdatasync=1 -thread -rw=randread -size=10G -filename=fio_randread_test.txt -name='fio randread test' -iodepth=4 -runtime=60 -numjobs=4 -group_reporting --output-format=json --output=fio_randread_result.json
    ```

- The mix test of sequential Write and random Read:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```bash
    ./fio -ioengine=psync -bs=32k -fdatasync=1 -thread -rw=randrw -percentage_random=100,0 -size=10G -filename=fio_randread_write_test.txt -name='fio mixed randread and sequential write test' -iodepth=4 -runtime=60 -numjobs=4 -group_reporting --output-format=json --output=fio_randread_write_test.json
    ```

### Error `UNREACHABLE! "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: "` when deploying TiDB using TiDB Ansible

Two possible reasons and solutions:

- The SSH mutual trust is not configured as required. Itâ€™s recommended to follow [the steps described in the official document](/online-deployment-using-ansible.md#step-5-configure-the-ssh-mutual-trust-and-sudo-rules-on-the-control-machine) and check whether it is successfully configured using `ansible -i inventory.ini all -m shell -a 'whoami' -b`.
- If it involves the scenario where a single server is assigned multiple roles, for example, the mixed deployment of multiple components or multiple TiKV instances are deployed on a single server, this error might be caused by the SSH reuse mechanism. You can use the option of `ansible â€¦ -f 1` to avoid this error.

## Cluster management

### Daily management

#### What are the common operations of TiDB Ansible?

| Job                               | Playbook                                 |
|:----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| Start the cluster                 | `ansible-playbook start.yml`             |
| Stop the cluster                  | `ansible-playbook stop.yml`              |
| Destroy the cluster               | `ansible-playbook unsafe_cleanup.yml` (If the deployment directory is a mount point, an error will be reported, but implementation results will remain unaffected) |
| Clean data (for test)             | `ansible-playbook unsafe_cleanup_data.yml` |
| Apply rolling updates                  | `ansible-playbook rolling_update.yml`    |
| Apply rolling updates to TiKV   | `ansible-playbook rolling_update.yml --tags=tikv` |
| Apply rolling updates to components except PD | `ansible-playbook rolling_update.yml --skip-tags=pd` |
| Apply rolling updates to the monitoring components | `ansible-playbook rolling_update_monitor.yml` |

#### How to log into TiDB?

You can log into TiDB like logging into MySQL. For example:

```bash
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -uroot -P4000
```

#### How to modify the system variables in TiDB?

Similar to MySQL, TiDB includes static and solid parameters. You can directly modify static parameters using `set global xxx = n`, but the new value of a parameter is only effective within the life cycle in this instance.

#### Where and what are the data directories in TiDB (TiKV)?

TiKV data is located in the [`--data-dir`](/command-line-flags-for-tikv-configuration.md#--data-dir), which include four directories of backup, db, raft, and snap, used to store backup, data, Raft data, and mirror data respectively.

#### What are the system tables in TiDB?

Similar to MySQL, TiDB includes system tables as well, used to store the information required by the server when it runs. See [TiDB system table](/mysql-schema.md).

#### Where are the TiDB/PD/TiKV logs?

By default, TiDB/PD/TiKV outputs standard error in the logs. If a log file is specified by `--log-file` during the startup, the log is output to the specified file and executes rotation daily.

#### How to safely stop TiDB?

If the cluster is deployed using TiDB Ansible, you can use the `ansible-playbook stop.yml` command to stop the TiDB cluster. If the cluster is not deployed using TiDB Ansible, `kill` all the services directly. The components of TiDB will do `graceful shutdown`.

#### Can `kill` be executed in TiDB?

- You can `kill` DML statements. First use `show processlist` to find the ID corresponding with the session, and then run `kill tidb [session id]`.
- You can `kill` DDL statements. First use `admin show ddl jobs` to find the ID of the DDL job you need to kill, and then run `admin cancel ddl jobs 'job_id' [, 'job_id'] ...`. For more details, see the [`ADMIN` statement](/sql-statements/sql-statement-admin.md).

#### Does TiDB support session timeout?

TiDB does not currently support session timeout at the database level. At present, if you want to achieve timeout, when there is no LB (Load Balancing), you need to record the ID of the initiated Session on the application side. You can customize the timeout through the application. After timeout, you need to go to the node that initiated the Query Use `kill tidb [session id]` to kill SQL. It is currently recommended to use an application program to achieve session timeout. When the timeout period is reached, the application layer will throw an exception and continue to execute subsequent program segments.

#### What is the TiDB version management strategy for production environment? How to avoid frequent upgrade?

Currently, TiDB has a standard management of various versions. Each release contains a detailed change log and [release notes](/releases/release-notes.md). Whether it is necessary to upgrade in the production environment depends on the application system. It is recommended to learn the details about the functional differences between the previous and later versions before upgrading.

Take `Release Version: v1.0.3-1-ga80e796` as an example of version number description:

- `v1.0.3` indicates the standard GA version.
- `-1` indicates the current version has one commit.
- `ga80e796` indicates the version `git-hash`.

#### What's the difference between various TiDB master versions? How to avoid using the wrong TiDB Ansible version?

The TiDB community is highly active. After the 1.0 GA release, the engineers have been keeping optimizing and fixing bugs. Therefore, the TiDB version is updated quite fast. If you want to keep informed of the latest version, see [TiDB Weekly update](https://pingcap.com/weekly/).

It is not recommended to deploy the TiDB cluster using TiDB Ansible. [Deploy TiDB using TiUP](/production-deployment-using-tiup.md) instead. TiDB has a unified management of the version number after the 1.0 GA release. You can view the version number using the following two methods:

- `select tidb_version()`
- `tidb-server -V`

#### Is there a graphical deployment tool for TiDB?

Currently no.

#### How to scale TiDB horizontally?

As your business grows, your database might face the following three bottlenecks:

- Lack of storage resources which means that the disk space is not enough.

- Lack of computing resources such as high CPU occupancy.

- Not enough write and read capacity.

You can scale TiDB as your business grows.

- If the disk space is not enough, you can increase the capacity simply by adding more TiKV nodes. When the new node is started, PD will migrate the data from other nodes to the new node automatically.

- If the computing resources are not enough, check the CPU consumption situation first before adding more TiDB nodes or TiKV nodes. When a TiDB node is added, you can configure it in the Load Balancer.

- If the capacity is not enough, you can add both TiDB nodes and TiKV nodes.

#### If Percolator uses distributed locks and the crash client keeps the lock, will the lock not be released?

For more details, see [Percolator and TiDB Transaction Algorithm](https://pingcap.com/blog-cn/percolator-and-txn/) in Chinese.

#### Why does TiDB use gRPC instead of Thrift? Is it because Google uses it?

Not really. We need some good features of gRPC, such as flow control, encryption and streaming.

#### What does the 92 indicate in `like(bindo.customers.name, jason%, 92)`?

The 92 indicates the escape character, which is ASCII 92 by default.

#### Why does the data length shown by `information_schema.tables.data_length` differ from the store size on the TiKV monitoring panel?

Two reasons:

- The two results are calculated in different ways. `information_schema.tables.data_length` is an estimated value by calculating the averaged length of each row, while the store size on the TiKV monitoring panel sums up the length of the data files (the SST files of RocksDB) in a single TiKV instance.
- `information_schema.tables.data_length` is a logical value, while the store size is a physical value. The redundant data generated by multiple versions of the transaction is not included in the logical value, while the redundant data is compressed by TiKV in the physical value.

### PD management

#### The `TiKV cluster is not bootstrapped` message is displayed when I access PD

Most of the APIs of PD are available only when the TiKV cluster is initialized. This message is displayed if PD is accessed when PD is started while TiKV is not started when a new cluster is deployed. If this message is displayed, start the TiKV cluster. When TiKV is initialized, PD is accessible.

#### The `etcd cluster ID mismatch` message is displayed when starting PD

This is because the `--initial-cluster` in the PD startup parameter contains a member that doesn't belong to this cluster. To solve this problem, check the corresponding cluster of each member, remove the wrong member, and then restart PD.

#### What's the maximum tolerance for time synchronization error of PD?

PD can tolerate any synchronization error, but a larger error value means a larger gap between the timestamp allocated by the PD and the physical time, which will affect functions such as read of historical versions.

#### How does the client connection find PD?

The client connection can only access the cluster through TiDB. TiDB connects PD and TiKV. PD and TiKV are transparent to the client. When TiDB connects to any PD, the PD tells TiDB who is the current leader. If this PD is not the leader, TiDB reconnects to the leader PD.

#### What is the difference between the `leader-schedule-limit` and `region-schedule-limit` scheduling parameters in PD?

- The `leader-schedule-limit` scheduling parameter is used to balance the Leader number of different TiKV servers, affecting the load of query processing.
- The `region-schedule-limit` scheduling parameter is used to balance the replica number of different TiKV servers, affecting the data amount of different nodes.

#### Is the number of replicas in each region configurable? If yes, how to configure it?

Yes. Currently, you can only update the global number of replicas. When started for the first time, PD reads the configuration file (conf/pd.yml) and uses the max-replicas configuration in it. If you want to update the number later, use the pd-ctl configuration command `config set max-replicas $num` and view the enabled configuration using `config show all`. The updating does not affect the applications and is configured in the background.

Make sure that the total number of TiKV instances is always greater than or equal to the number of replicas you set. For example, 3 replicas need 3 TiKV instances at least. Additional storage requirements need to be estimated before increasing the number of replicas. For more information about pd-ctl, see [PD Control User Guide](/pd-control.md).

#### How to check the health status of the whole cluster when lacking command line cluster management tools?

You can determine the general status of the cluster using the pd-ctl tool. For detailed cluster status, you need to use the monitor to determine.

#### How to delete the monitoring data of a cluster node that is offline?

The offline node usually indicates the TiKV node. You can determine whether the offline process is finished by the pd-ctl or the monitor. After the node is offline, perform the following steps:

1. Manually stop the relevant services on the offline node.
2. Delete the `node_exporter` data of the corresponding node from the Prometheus configuration file.
3. Delete the data of the corresponding node from Ansible `inventory.ini`.

#### Why couldn't I connect to the PD server using `127.0.0.1` when I was using the PD Control?

If your TiDB cluster is deployed using TiDB Ansible, the PD external service port is not bound to `127.0.0.1`, so PD Control does not recognize `127.0.0.1` and you can only connect to it using the local IP address.

### TiDB server management

#### How to set the `lease` parameter in TiDB?

The lease parameter (`--lease=60`) is set from the command line when starting a TiDB server. The value of the lease parameter impacts the Database Schema Changes (DDL) speed of the current session. In the testing environments, you can set the value to 1s for to speed up the testing cycle. But in the production environments, it is recommended to set the value to minutes (for example, 60) to ensure the DDL safety.

#### What is the processing time of a DDL operation?

The processing time is different for different scenarios. Generally, you can consider the following three scenarios:

1. The `Add Index` operation with a relatively small number of rows in the corresponding data table: about 3s
2. The `Add Index` operation with a relatively large number of rows in the corresponding data table: the processing time depends on the specific number of rows and the QPS at that time (the `Add Index` operation has a lower priority than ordinary SQL operations)
3. Other DDL operations: about 1s

If the TiDB server instance that receives the DDL request is the same TiDB server instance that the DDL owner is in, the first and third scenarios above may cost only dozens to hundreds of milliseconds.

#### Why it is very slow to run DDL statements sometimes?

Possible reasons:

- If you run multiple DDL statements together, the last few DDL statements might run slowly. This is because the DDL statements are executed serially in the TiDB cluster.
- After you start the cluster successfully, the first DDL operation may take a longer time to run, usually around 30s. This is because the TiDB cluster is electing the leader that processes DDL statements.
- The processing time of DDL statements in the first ten minutes after starting TiDB would be much longer than the normal case if you meet the following conditions: 1) TiDB cannot communicate with PD as usual when you are stopping TiDB (including the case of power failure); 2) TiDB fails to clean up the registration data from PD in time because TiDB is stopped by the `kill -9` command. If you run DDL statements during this period, for the state change of each DDL, you need to wait for 2 * lease (lease = 45s).
- If a communication issue occurs between a TiDB server and a PD server in the cluster, the TiDB server cannot get or update the version information from the PD server in time. In this case, you need to wait for 2 * lease for the state processing of each DDL.

#### Can I use S3 as the backend storage engine in TiDB?

No. Currently, TiDB only supports the distributed storage engine and the Goleveldb/RocksDB/BoltDB engine.

#### Can the `Information_schema` support more real information?

As part of MySQL compatibility, TiDB supports a number of `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables. Many of these tables also have a corresponding SHOW command. For more information, see [Information Schema](/information-schema/information-schema.md).

#### What's the explanation of the TiDB Backoff type scenario?

In the communication process between the TiDB server and the TiKV server, the `Server is busy` or `backoff.maxsleep 20000ms` log message is displayed when processing a large volume of data. This is because the system is busy while the TiKV server processes data. At this time, usually you can view that the TiKV host resources usage rate is high. If this occurs, you can increase the server capacity according to the resources usage.

#### What is the main reason of TiDB TiClient type?

The TiClient Region Error indicator describes the error types and metrics that appear when the TiDB server as a client accesses the TiKV server through the KV interface to perform data operations. The error types include `not_leader` and `stale_epoch`. These errors occur when the TiDB server manipulates the Region leader data according to its own cache information, the Region leader has migrated, or the current TiKV Region information and the routing information of the TiDB cache are inconsistent. Generally, in this case, the TiDB server will automatically retrieve the latest routing data from PD and redo the previous operation.

#### What's the maximum number of concurrent connections that TiDB supports?

By default, there is no limit on the maximum number of connections per TiDB server. If too large concurrency leads to an increase of response time, it is recommended to increase the capacity by adding TiDB nodes.

#### How to view the creation time of a table?

The `create_time` of tables in the `information_schema` is the creation time.

#### What is the meaning of `EXPENSIVE_QUERY` in the TiDB log?

When TiDB is executing a SQL statement, the query will be `EXPENSIVE_QUERY` if each operator is estimated to process over 10000 pieces of data. You can modify the `tidb-server` configuration parameter to adjust the threshold and then restart the `tidb-server`.

### TiKV server management

#### What is the recommended number of replicas in the TiKV cluster? Is it better to keep the minimum number for high availability?

3 replicas for each Region is sufficient for a testing environment. However, you should never operate a TiKV cluster with under 3 nodes in a production scenario. Depending on infrastructure, workload, and resiliency needs, you may wish to increase this number. It is worth noting that the higher the copy, the lower the performance, but the higher the security.

#### The `cluster ID mismatch` message is displayed when starting TiKV

This is because the cluster ID stored in local TiKV is different from the cluster ID specified by PD. When a new PD cluster is deployed, PD generates random cluster IDs. TiKV gets the cluster ID from PD and stores the cluster ID locally when it is initialized. The next time when TiKV is started, it checks the local cluster ID with the cluster ID in PD. If the cluster IDs don't match, the `cluster ID mismatch` message is displayed and TiKV exits.

If you previously deploy a PD cluster, but then you remove the PD data and deploy a new PD cluster, this error occurs because TiKV uses the old data to connect to the new PD cluster.

#### The `duplicated store address` message is displayed when starting TiKV

This is because the address in the startup parameter has been registered in the PD cluster by other TiKVs. Common conditions that cause this error: There is no data folder in the path specified by TiKV `--data-dir` (no update --data-dir after deleting or moving), restart the TiKV with the previous parameters.Please try [store delete](https://github.com/pingcap/pd/tree/55db505e8f35e8ab4e00efd202beb27a8ecc40fb/tools/pd-ctl#store-delete--label--weight-store_id----jqquery-string) function of pd-ctl, delete the previous store, and then restart TiKV.

#### TiKV primary node and secondary node use the same compression algorithm, why the results are different?

Currently, some files of TiKV primary node have a higher compression rate, which depends on the underlying data distribution and RocksDB implementation. It is normal that the data size fluctuates occasionally. The underlying storage engine adjusts data as needed.

#### What are the features of TiKV block cache?

TiKV implements the Column Family (CF) feature of RocksDB. By default, the KV data is eventually stored in the 3 CFs (default, write and lock) within RocksDB.

- The default CF stores real data and the corresponding parameter is in `[rocksdb.defaultcf]`.
- The write CF stores the data version information (MVCC) and index-related data, and the corresponding parameter is in `[rocksdb.writecf]`.
- The lock CF stores the lock information and the system uses the default parameter.
- The Raft RocksDB instance stores Raft logs. The default CF mainly stores Raft logs and the corresponding parameter is in `[raftdb.defaultcf]`.
- All CFs have a shared block-cache to cache data blocks and improve RocksDB read speed. The size of block-cache is controlled by the `block-cache-size` parameter. A larger value of the parameter means more hot data can be cached and is more favorable to read operation. At the same time, it consumes more system memory.
- Each CF has an individual write-buffer and the size is controlled by the `write-buffer-size` parameter.

#### Why is the TiKV channel full?

- The Raftstore thread is too slow or blocked by I/O. You can view the CPU usage status of Raftstore.
- TiKV is too busy (CPU, disk I/O, etc.) and cannot manage to handle it.

#### Why does TiKV frequently switch Region leader?

- Network problem results in the communication stuck among nodes. You can check Report failures monitoring.
- The node of the original main Leader is stuck, resulting in failure to reach out to the Follower in time.
- Raftstore thread stuck.

#### If a node is down, will the service be affected? If yes, how long?

TiKV uses Raft to replicate data among multiple replicas (by default 3 replicas for each Region). If one replica goes wrong, the other replicas can guarantee data safety. Based on the Raft protocol, if a single leader fails as the node goes down, a follower in another node is soon elected as the Region leader after a maximum of 2 * lease time (lease time is 10 seconds).

#### What are the TiKV scenarios that take up high I/O, memory, CPU, and exceed the parameter configuration?

Writing or reading a large volume of data in TiKV takes up high I/O, memory and CPU. Executing very complex queries costs a lot of memory and CPU resources, such as the scenario that generates large intermediate result sets.

#### Does TiKV support SAS/SATA disks or mixed deployment of SSD/SAS disks?

No. For OLTP scenarios, TiDB requires high I/O disks for data access and operation. As a distributed database with strong consistency, TiDB has some write amplification such as replica replication and bottom layer storage compaction. Therefore, it is recommended to use NVMe SSD as the storage disks in TiDB best practices. Mixed deployment of TiKV and PD is not supported.

#### Is the Range of the Key data table divided before data access?

No. It differs from the table splitting rules of MySQL. In TiKV, the table Range is dynamically split based on the size of Region.

#### How does Region split?

Region is not divided in advance, but it follows a Region split mechanism. When the Region size exceeds the value of the `region-max-size` or `region-max-keys` parameters, split is triggered. After the split, the information is reported to PD.

#### Does TiKV have the `innodb_flush_log_trx_commit` parameter like MySQL, to guarantee the security of data?

Yes. Currently, the standalone storage engine uses two RocksDB instances. One instance is used to store the raft-log. When the `sync-log` parameter in TiKV is set to true, each commit is mandatorily flushed to the raft-log. If a crash occurs, you can restore the KV data using the raft-log.

#### What is the recommended server configuration for WAL storage, such as SSD, RAID level, cache strategy of RAID card, NUMA configuration, file system, I/O scheduling strategy of the operating system?

WAL belongs to ordered writing, and currently, we do not apply a unique configuration to it. Recommended configuration is as follows:

- SSD
- RAID 10 preferred
- Cache strategy of RAID card and I/O scheduling strategy of the operating system: currently no specific best practices; you can use the default configuration in Linux 7 or later
- NUMA: no specific suggestion; for memory allocation strategy, you can use `interleave = all`
- File system: ext4

#### How is the write performance in the most strict data available mode (`sync-log = true`)?

Generally, enabling `sync-log` reduces about 30% of the performance. For write performance when `sync-log` is set to `false`, see [Performance test result for TiDB using Sysbench](/benchmark/v3.0-performance-benchmarking-with-sysbench.md).

#### Can Raft + multiple replicas in the TiKV architecture achieve absolute data safety? Is it necessary to apply the most strict mode (`sync-log = true`) to a standalone storage?

Data is redundantly replicated between TiKV nodes using the [Raft Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/) to ensure recoverability should a node failure occur. Only when the data has been written into more than 50% of the replicas will the application return ACK (two out of three nodes). However, theoretically, two nodes might crash. Therefore, except for scenarios with less strict requirement on data safety but extreme requirement on performance, it is strongly recommended that you enable the `sync-log` mode.

As an alternative to using `sync-log`, you may also consider having five replicas instead of three in your Raft group. This would allow for the failure of two replicas, while still providing data safety.

For a standalone TiKV node, it is still recommended to enable the `sync-log` mode. Otherwise, the last write might be lost in case of a node failure.

#### Since TiKV uses the Raft protocol, multiple network roundtrips occur during data writing. What is the actual write delay?

Theoretically, TiDB has a write delay of 4 more network roundtrips than standalone databases.

#### Does TiDB have an InnoDB memcached plugin like MySQL which can directly use the KV interface and does not need the independent cache?

TiKV supports calling the interface separately. Theoretically, you can take an instance as the cache. Because TiDB is a distributed relational database, we do not support TiKV separately.

#### What is the Coprocessor component used for?

- Reduce the data transmission between TiDB and TiKV
- Make full use of the distributed computing resources of TiKV to execute computing pushdown.

#### The error message `IO error: No space left on device While appending to file` is displayed

This is because the disk space is not enough. You need to add nodes or enlarge the disk space.

#### Why does the OOM (Out of Memory) error occur frequently in TiKV?

The memory usage of TiKV mainly comes from the block-cache of RocksDB, which is 40% of the system memory size by default. When the OOM error occurs frequently in TiKV, you should check whether the value of `block-cache-size` is set too high. In addition, when multiple TiKV instances are deployed on a single machine, you need to explicitly configure the parameter to prevent multiple instances from using too much system memory that results in the OOM error.

#### Can both TiDB data and RawKV data be stored in the same TiKV cluster?

No. TiDB (or data created from the transactional API) relies on a specific key format. It is not compatible with data created from RawKV API (or data from other RawKV-based services).

### TiDB testing

#### What is the performance test result for TiDB using Sysbench?

At the beginning, many users tend to do a benchmark test or a comparison test between TiDB and MySQL. We have also done a similar official test and find the test result is consistent at large, although the test data has some bias. Because the architecture of TiDB differs greatly from MySQL, it is hard to find a benchmark point. The suggestions are as follows:

- Do not spend too much time on the benchmark test. Pay more attention to the difference of scenarios using TiDB.
- See [Performance test result for TiDB using Sysbench](/benchmark/v3.0-performance-benchmarking-with-sysbench.md).

#### What's the relationship between the TiDB cluster capacity (QPS) and the number of nodes? How does TiDB compare to MySQL?

- Within 10 nodes, the relationship between TiDB write capacity (Insert TPS) and the number of nodes is roughly 40% linear increase. Because MySQL uses single-node write, its write capacity cannot be scaled.
- In MySQL, the read capacity can be increased by adding secondary database, but the write capacity cannot be increased except using sharding, which has many problems.
- In TiDB, both the read and write capacity can be easily increased by adding more nodes.

#### The performance test of MySQL and TiDB by our DBA shows that the performance of a standalone TiDB is not as good as MySQL

TiDB is designed for scenarios where sharding is used because the capacity of a MySQL standalone is limited, and where strong consistency and complete distributed transactions are required. One of the advantages of TiDB is pushing down computing to the storage nodes to execute concurrent computing.

TiDB is not suitable for tables of small size (such as below ten million level), because its strength in concurrency cannot be shown with a small size of data and limited Regions. A typical example is the counter table, in which records of a few lines are updated high frequently. In TiDB, these lines become several Key-Value pairs in the storage engine, and then settle into a Region located on a single node. The overhead of background replication to guarantee strong consistency and operations from TiDB to TiKV leads to a poorer performance than a MySQL standalone.

### Backup and restoration

#### How to back up data in TiDB?

Currently, for the backup of a large volume of data, the preferred method is using [BR](/br/backup-and-restore-tool.md). Otherwise, the recommended tool is [Dumpling](/backup-and-restore-using-dumpling-lightning.md). Although the official MySQL tool `mysqldump` is also supported in TiDB to back up and restore data, its performance is worse than [BR](/br/backup-and-restore-tool.md) and it needs much more time to back up and restore large volumes of data.

## Monitoring

- For details of Prometheus monitoring framework, see [Overview of the Monitoring Framework](/tidb-monitoring-framework.md).
- For details of key metrics of monitoring, see [Key Metrics](/grafana-overview-dashboard.md).

### Is there a better way of monitoring the key metrics?

The monitoring system of TiDB consists of Prometheus and Grafana. From the dashboard in Grafana, you can monitor various running metrics of TiDB which include the monitoring metrics of system resources, of client connection and SQL operation, of internal communication and Region scheduling. With these metrics, the database administrator can better understand the system running status, running bottlenecks and so on. In the practice of monitoring these metrics, we list the key metrics of each TiDB component. Generally you only need to pay attention to these common metrics. For details, see [official documentation](/grafana-overview-dashboard.md).

### The Prometheus monitoring data is deleted every 15 days by default. Could I set it to two months or delete the monitoring data manually?

Yes. Find the startup script on the machine where Prometheus is started, edit the startup parameter and restart Prometheus.

```config
--storage.tsdb.retention="60d"
```

### Region Health monitor

In TiDB 2.0, Region health is monitored in the PD metric monitoring page, in which the `Region Health` monitoring item shows the statistics of all the Region replica status. `miss` means shortage of replicas and `extra` means the extra replica exists. In addition, `Region Health` also shows the isolation level by `label`. `level-1` means the Region replicas are isolated physically in the first `label` level. All the Regions are in `level-0` when `location label` is not configured.

### What is the meaning of `selectsimplefull` in Statement Count monitor?

It means full table scan but the table might be a small system table.

### What is the difference between `QPS` and `Statement OPS` in the monitor?

The `QPS` statistics is about all the SQL statements, including `use database`, `load data`, `begin`, `commit`, `set`, `show`, `insert` and `select`.

The `Statement OPS` statistics is only about applications related SQL statements, including `select`, `update` and `insert`, therefore the `Statement OPS` statistics matches the applications better.
