            ### What is changed, added or deleted? (Required)

            This is a test PR for the PR creation workflow.

            ### Which TiDB version(s) do your changes apply to? (Required)

            <!-- Fill in "x" in [] to tick the checkbox below.-->

            **Tips for choosing the affected version(s):**

            By default, **CHOOSE MASTER ONLY** so your changes will be applied to the next TiDB major or minor releases. If your PR involves a product feature behavior change or a compatibility change, **CHOOSE THE AFFECTED RELEASE BRANCH(ES) AND MASTER**.
