# Role-Based Access Control

The implementation of TiDB's role-based access control (RBAC) system is similar to that of MySQL 8.0. TiDB is compatible with most RBAC syntax of MySQL.

This document introduces TiDB RBAC-related operations and implementation.

## RBAC operations

A role is a collection of a series of privileges. You can do the following operations:

- Create a role.
- Delete a role.
- Grant a privilege to a role.
- Grant a role to another user. That user can obtain the privileges involved in the role, after enabling the role.

### Create a role

For example, you can use the following statement to create the roles `app_developer`, `app_read`, and `app_write`:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE ROLE 'app_developer', 'app_read', 'app_write';
```

For the role naming format and rule, see [TiDB User Account Management](/user-account-management.md).

Roles are stored in the `mysql.user` table. The name of the role you are trying to create must be unique; otherwise, an error is reported.

To create a role, you need the `CREATE ROLE` or `CREATE USER` privilege.

### Grant a privilege to a role

The operation of granting a privilege to a role is the same with that of granting a privilege to a user. For details, see [TiDB Privilege Management](/privilege-management.md).

For example, you can use the following statement to grant the `app_read` role the privilege to read the `app_db` database:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON app_db.* TO 'app_read'@'%';
```

You can use the following statement to grant the `app_write` role the privilege to write data to the `app_db` database:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON app_db.* TO 'app_write'@'%';;
```

You can use the following statement to grant the `app_developer` role all privileges on the `app_db` database:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
GRANT ALL ON app_db.* TO 'app_developer';
```

### Grant a role to a user

Assume that a user `dev1` has the developer role with all the privileges on `app_db`; two users `read_user1` and `read_user2` have the read-only privilege on `app_db`; and a user `rw_user1` has read and write privileges on `app_db`. 

Use `CREATE USER` to create the users:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
CREATE USER 'dev1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'dev1pass';
CREATE USER 'read_user1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'read_user1pass';
CREATE USER 'read_user2'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'read_user2pass';
CREATE USER 'rw_user1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'rw_user1pass';
```

Then use `GRANT` to grant roles to users

```sql
GRANT 'app_developer' TO 'dev1'@'localhost';
GRANT 'app_read' TO 'read_user1'@'localhost', 'read_user2'@'localhost';
GRANT 'app_read', 'app_write' TO 'rw_user1'@'localhost';
```

To grant a role to another user or revoke a role, you need the `SUPER` privilege.

Granting a role to a user does not mean enabling the role immediately. Enabling a role is another operation.

The following operations might form a "relation loop:"

```sql
CREATE USER 'u1', 'u2';
CREATE ROLE 'r1', 'r2';

GRANT 'u1' TO 'u1';
GRANT 'r1' TO 'r1';

GRANT 'r2' TO 'u2';
GRANT 'u2' TO 'r2';
```

TiDB supports this multi-level authorization relationship. You can use it to implement privilege inheritance.

### Check a role's privileges

You can use the `SHOW GRANTS` statement to check what privileges have been granted to the user.

To check privilege-related information of another user, you need the `SELECT` privilege on the `mysql` database.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'dev1'@'localhost';
```

```
+-------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for dev1@localhost                       |
+-------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `dev1`@`localhost`        |
| GRANT `app_developer`@`%` TO `dev1`@`localhost` |
+-------------------------------------------------+
```

You can use the `USING` option in `SHOW GRANTS` to check a role's privileges:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'dev1'@'localhost' USING 'app_developer';
```

```sql
+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for dev1@localhost                                |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `dev1`@`localhost`                 |
| GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `app_db`.* TO `dev1`@`localhost` |
| GRANT `app_developer`@`%` TO `dev1`@`localhost`          |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
```

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'rw_user1'@'localhost' USING 'app_read', 'app_write';
```

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for rw_user1@localhost                                                |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `rw_user1`@`localhost`                                 |
| GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON `app_db`.* TO `rw_user1`@`localhost` |
| GRANT `app_read`@`%`,`app_write`@`%` TO `rw_user1`@`localhost`               |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'read_user1'@'localhost' USING 'app_read';
```

```
+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for read_user1@localhost                        |
+--------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `read_user1`@`localhost`         |
| GRANT SELECT ON `app_db`.* TO `read_user1`@`localhost` |
| GRANT `app_read`@`%` TO `read_user1`@`localhost`       |
+--------------------------------------------------------+
```

You can use `SHOW GRANTS` or `SHOW GRANTS FOR CURRENT_USER()` to check the current user's privileges. `SHOW GRANTS` and `SHOW GRANTS FOR CURRENT_USER()` are different in the following aspects:

- `SHOW GRANTS` shows the privilege of the enabled role for the current user.
- `SHOW GRANTS FOR CURRENT_USER()` does not show the enabled role's privilege.

### Set the default role

After a role is granted to a user, it does not take effect immediately. Only after the user enables this role, he can use the privilege the role owns.

You can set default roles for a user. When the user logs in, the default roles are automatically enabled.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SET DEFAULT ROLE
    {NONE | ALL | role [, role ] ...}
    TO user [, user ]
```

For example, you can use the following statement to set default roles of `rw_user1@localhost` to `app_read` and `app_write`:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SET DEFAULT ROLE app_read, app_write TO 'rw_user1'@'localhost';
```

You can use the following statement to set default roles of `dev1@localhost` to all roles:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SET DEFAULT ROLE ALL TO 'dev1'@'localhost';
```

You can use the following statement to disable all default roles of `dev1@localhost`:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SET DEFAULT ROLE NONE TO 'dev1'@'localhost';
```

> **Note:**
>
> You need to grant the role to the user before you set the default role to this role.

### Enable a role in the current session

You can enable some role(s) in the current session.

```sql
SET ROLE {
    DEFAULT
  | NONE
  | ALL
  | ALL EXCEPT role [, role ] ...
  | role [, role ] ...
}
```

For example, after `rw_user1` logs in, you can use the following statement to enable roles `app_read` and `app_write` that are valid only in the current session:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SET ROLE 'app_read', 'app_write';
```

You can use the following statement to enable the default role of the current user:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SET ROLE DEFAULT
```

You can use the following statement to enable all roles granted to the current user:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SET ROLE ALL
```

You can use the following statement to disable all roles:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SET ROLE NONE
```

You can use the following statement to enable roles except `app_read`:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SET ROLE ALL EXCEPT 'app_read'
```

> **Note:**
>
> If you use `SET ROLE` to enable a role, this role is valid only in the current session.

### Check the current enabled role

The current user can use the `CURRENT_ROLE()` function to check which role has been enabled by the current user. 

For example, you can grant default roles to `rw_user1'@'localhost`:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SET DEFAULT ROLE ALL TO 'rw_user1'@'localhost';

After `rw_user1@localhost` logs in, you can execute the following statement:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
```

```
+--------------------------------+
| CURRENT_ROLE()                 |
+--------------------------------+
| `app_read`@`%`,`app_write`@`%` |
+--------------------------------+
```

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SET ROLE 'app_read'; SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
```

```
+----------------+
| CURRENT_ROLE() |
+----------------+
| `app_read`@`%` |
+----------------+
```

### Revoke a role

You can use the following statement to revoke the `app_read` role granted to the users `read_user1@localhost` and `read_user2@localhost`:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
REVOKE 'app_read' FROM 'read_user1'@'localhost', 'read_user2'@'localhost';
```

You can use the following statement to revoke the roles `app_read` and `app_write` granted to the `rw_user1@localhost` user:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
REVOKE 'app_read', 'app_write' FROM 'rw_user1'@'localhost';
```

The operation of revoking a role from a user is atomic. If you fail to revoke a role, this operation rolls back.

### Revoke a privilege

The `REVOKE` statement is reverse to `GRANT`. You can use `REVOKE` to revoke the privileges of `app_write`.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON app_db.* FROM 'app_write';
```

For details, see [TiDB Privilege Management](/privilege-management.md).

### Delete a role

You can use the following statement to delete roles `app_read` and `app_write`:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
DROP ROLE 'app_read', 'app_write';
```

This operation deletes the role records of `app_read` and `app_write` in the `mysql.user` table and related records in the authorization table, and terminates the authorization related to the two roles.

To delete a role, you need the `DROP ROLE` or `DROP USER` privilege.

### Authorization table

In addition to four system [privilege tables](/privilege-management.md#privilege-table), the RBAC system introduces two new system privilege tables:

- `mysql.role_edges`: records the authorization relationship of the role and user.
- `mysql.default_roles`: records default roles of each user.

#### `mysql.role_edges`

`mysql.role_edges` contains the following data:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
select * from mysql.role_edges;
```

```
+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+-------------------+
| FROM_HOST | FROM_USER | TO_HOST | TO_USER | WITH_ADMIN_OPTION |
+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+-------------------+
| %         | r_1       | %       | u_1     | N                 |
+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+-------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

- `FROM_HOST` and `FROM_USER` indicate the role's host name and user name respectively.
- `TO_HOST` and `TO_USER` indicate the host name and user name of the user to which a role is granted.

#### `mysql.default_roles`

`mysql.default_roles` shows which roles have been enabled by default for each user.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
select * from mysql.default_roles;
```

```
+------+------+-------------------+-------------------+
| HOST | USER | DEFAULT_ROLE_HOST | DEFAULT_ROLE_USER |
+------+------+-------------------+-------------------+
| %    | u_1  | %                 | r_1               |
| %    | u_1  | %                 | r_2               |
+------+------+-------------------+-------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- `HOST` and `USER` indicate the user's host name and user name respectively.
- `DEFAULT_ROLE_HOST` and `DEFAULT_ROLE_USER` indicate the host name and user name of the default role respectively.
