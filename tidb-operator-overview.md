# TiDB Operator

[TiDB Operator](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator) is an automatic operation system for TiDB clusters in Kubernetes. It provides full life-cycle management for TiDB including deployment, upgrades, scaling, backup, fail-over, and configuration changes. With TiDB Operator, TiDB can run seamlessly in the Kubernetes clusters deployed on a public or private cloud.

Currently, the TiDB Operator documentation (also named as TiDB in Kubernetes documentation) is independent of the TiDB documentation. To access the documentation, click the following link:
