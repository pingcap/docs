# TiDB Migration Tools Overview

TiDB provides multiple data migration tools for different scenarios such as full data migration, incremental data migration, backup and restore, and data replication.

This document introduces the user scenarios, supported upstreams and downstreams, advantages, and limitations of these tools. You can choose the right tool according to your needs.

<!--The following diagram shows the user scenario of each migration tool.

## [TiDB Data Migration (DM)](/dm/dm-overview.md)

- **User scenario**: Data migration from MySQL-compatible databases to TiDB
- **Upstream**: MySQL, MariaDB, Aurora
- **Downstream**: TiDB
- **Advantages**:
    - A convenient and unified data migration task management tool that supports full data migration and incremental replication
    - Support filtering tables and operations
    - Support shard merge and migration
- **Limitation**: Data import speed is roughly the same as that of TiDB Lightning's [logical import mode](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-logical-import-mode.md), and a lot lower than that of TiDB Lightning's [physical import mode](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode.md). So it is recommended to use DM to migrate full data with a size of less than 1 TiB.

## [TiDB Lightning](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-overview.md)

- **User scenario**: Full data import into TiDB
- **Upstream (the imported source file)**:
    - Files exported from Dumpling
    - Parquet files exported by Amazon Aurora or Apache Hive
    - CSV files
    - Data from local disks or Amazon S3
- **Downstream**: TiDB
- **Advantages**:
    - Support quickly importing a large amount of data and quickly initializing a specific table in a TiDB cluster
    - Support checkpoints to store the import progress, so that `tidb-lightning` continues importing from where it lefts off after restarting
    - Support data filtering
- **Limitation**:
    - If [physical import mode](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode-usage.md) is used for data import, during the import process, the TiDB cluster cannot provide services.
    - If you do not want the TiDB services to be impacted, perform the data import according to TiDB Lightning [logical import mode](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-logical-import-mode-usage.md).

## [Dumpling](/dumpling-overview.md)

- **User scenario**: Full data export from MySQL or TiDB
- **Upstream**: MySQL, TiDB
- **Downstream (the output file)**: SQL, CSV
- **Advantages**:
    - Support the table-filter feature that enables you to filter data easier
    - Support exporting data to Amazon S3
- **Limitation**:
    - If you want to restore the exported data to a database other than TiDB, it is recommended to use Dumpling.
    - If you want to restore the exported data to another TiDB cluster, it is recommended to use Backup & Restore (BR).

## [TiCDC](/ticdc/ticdc-overview.md)

- **User scenario**: This tool is implemented by pulling TiKV change logs. It can restore cluster data to a consistent state with any upstream TSO, and support other systems to subscribe to data changes.
- **Upstream**: TiDB
- **Downstream**: TiDB, MySQL, Kafka, MQ, Confluent, storage services such as Amazon S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage, and NFS.
- **Advantages**: Provide TiCDC Open Protocol
- **Limitation**: TiCDC only replicates tables that have at least one valid index. The following scenarios are not supported:
    - The TiKV cluster that uses RawKV alone.
    - The DDL operation `CREATE SEQUENCE` and the `SEQUENCE` function in TiDB.

## [Backup & Restore (BR)](/br/backup-and-restore-overview.md)

- **User scenario**: Migrate a large amount of TiDB cluster data by backing up and restoring data
- **Upstream**: TiDB
- **Downstream (the output file)**: SST, backup.meta files, backup.lock files
- **Advantages**:
    - Suitable for migrating data to another TiDB cluster
    - Support backing up data to an external storage for disaster recovery
- **Limitation**:
    - When BR restores data to the upstream cluster of TiCDC, the restored data cannot be replicated to the downstream by TiCDC.
    - BR supports operations only between clusters that have the same `new_collation_enabled` value in the `mysql.tidb` table.

## [sync-diff-inspector](/sync-diff-inspector/sync-diff-inspector-overview.md)

- **User scenario**: Comparing data stored in the databases with the MySQL protocol
- **Upstream**: TiDB, MySQL
- **Downstream**: TiDB, MySQL
- **Advantages**: Can be used to repair data in the scenario where a small amount of data is inconsistent
- **Limitation**:
    - Online check is not supported for data migration between MySQL and TiDB.
    - JSON, BIT, BINARY, BLOB and other types of data are not supported.

## Install tools using TiUP

Since TiDB v4.0, TiUP acts as a package manager that helps you manage different cluster components in the TiDB ecosystem. Now you can manage any cluster component using a single command.

### Step 1. Install TiUP

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://tiup-mirrors.pingcap.com/install.sh | sh
```

Redeclare the global environment variable:

```shell
source ~/.bash_profile
```

### Step 2. Install components

You can use the following command to see the available components:

```shell
tiup list
```

The command outputs the available components:

```bash
Available components:

Install one or more components that you need. For example:

```shell
tiup install dm
```

```shell
tiup install dm tidb-lightning
```

> **Note:**
>
> To install a component of a specific version, use the `tiup install <component>[:version]` command.

### Step 3. Update TiUP and its components (optional)

It is recommended to see the release log and compatibility notes of the new version.

```shell
tiup update --self && tiup update dm
```
