# TiDB Introduction

[TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb) ("Ti" stands for Titanium) is an open-source NewSQL database that supports Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) workloads. It is MySQL compatible and features horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and high availability.

TiDB can be deployed on-premise or in-cloud. The following deployment options are officially supported by PingCAP:

- [TiUP Deployment](/production-deployment-using-tiup.md): This guide describes how to deploy TiDB using [TiUP](https://github.com/pingcap-incubator/tiup). It is strongly recommended for production deployment.
- [Docker Deployment](/test-deployment-using-docker.md): This guide describes how to deploy TiDB using Docker.
- [Docker Compose Deployment](/deploy-test-cluster-using-docker-compose.md): This guide describes how to deploy TiDB using Docker compose. You can follow this guide to quickly deploy a TiDB cluster for testing and development on your local drive.
- Kubernetes Deployment:

    You can use [TiDB Operator](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator) to deploy TiDB on:

    - [AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)](https://pingcap.com/docs/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/deploy-on-aws-eks/)
    - [GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)](https://pingcap.com/docs/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/deploy-on-gcp-gke/)
    - [Google Cloud Shell](https://pingcap.com/docs/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/deploy-tidb-from-kubernetes-gke/)
    - [Alibaba Cloud ACK (Container Service for Kubernetes)](https://pingcap.com/docs/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/deploy-on-alibaba-cloud/)

    Or deploy TiDB locally using:

    - [kind](https://pingcap.com/docs/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/get-started/#create-a-kubernetes-cluster-using-kind)
    - [Minikube](https://pingcap.com/docs/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/get-started/#create-a-kubernetes-cluster-using-minikube)

- [Binary Tarball Deployment](/production-deployment-from-binary-tarball.md): This guide describes how to deploy TiDB from a binary tarball in production. Guides for [development](/deploy-tidb-from-binary.md) and [testing](/test-deployment-from-binary-tarball.md) environments are also available.
