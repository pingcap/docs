# Analyze Slow Queries

To address the issue of slow queries，you need to take the following two steps:

1. Among many queries, identify which type of queries are slow.
2. Analyze why this type of queries are slow.

You can easily perform step 1 using the [slow query log](/dashboard/dashboard-slow-query.md) and the [statement summary table](/statement-summary-tables.md) features. It is recommended to use [TiDB Dashboard](/dashboard/dashboard-intro.md), which integrates the two features and directly displays the slow queries in your browser。
