# TiDB Cloud API v1beta Overview

[v1beta](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/api/v1beta) is a RESTful API that provides you with programmatic access to manage administrative objects within TiDB Cloud. Through this API, you can automatically and efficiently manage resources such as Projects, Clusters, Backups, Restores, Imports, Billings, and resources in the [Data Service](/tidb-cloud/data-service-overview.md).

Currently, you can use the following v1beta APIs to manage the resources in TiDB Cloud:

- [Project](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/api/v1beta/#tag/Project)
- [Cluster](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/api/v1beta/#tag/Cluster)

- [Import (Deprecated)](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/api/v1beta/#tag/Import)
