# TiDB Introduction

[TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb) ("Ti" stands for Titanium) is an open-source NewSQL database that supports Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) workloads. It is MySQL compatible and features horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and high availability.

TiDB can be deployed on-premise or in-cloud. The following deployment options are officially supported by PingCAP:

- [Ansible Deployment](/online-deployment-using-ansible.md): This guide describes how to deploy TiDB using TiDB Ansible. It is strongly recommended for production deployment.
- [Ansible Offline Deployment](/offline-deployment-using-ansible.md): If your environment has no access to the internet, you can follow this guide to see how to deploy a TiDB cluster offline using TiDB Ansible.
- [Docker Deployment](/test-deployment-using-docker.md): This guide describes how to deploy TiDB using Docker.
- [Binary Tarball Deployment](/production-deployment-from-binary-tarball.md): This guide describes how to deploy TiDB from a binary tarball in production. Guides for [development](/deploy-tidb-from-binary.md) and [testing](/test-deployment-from-binary-tarball.md) environments are also available.
