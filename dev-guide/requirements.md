# Build Requirements

Learn about the following requirements before building TiDB.

## Supported platforms

The following table lists TiDB support for common architectures and operating systems.

|Architecture|Operating System|Status|
|:------------|:----------------|:------|
|AMD64|Linux Ubuntu (14.04+)|Stable|
|AMD64|Linux CentOS (7+)|Stable|
|AMD64|macOS|Experimental|

## Prerequisites

+ Go [1.12+](https://golang.org/doc/install)
+ [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
+ GCC 4.8+ with static library
+ CMake 3.1+

The [check requirement script](/scripts/check_requirement.sh) can help you check prerequisites and install the missing ones automatically.

TiKV is well tested in a certain Rust version by us, and the exact version can be found in the `RUST_VERSION` file in TiKV's root directory. It is recommended to use the same version as we do.
