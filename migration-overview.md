# Migration Overview

This document provides an overview of TiDB data migration solutions to help you understand the data migration features and choose the most suitable solution based on your scenarios.

## Data migration features

- Full data migration: use `TiDB Lightning` to import data(CSV/Aurora Snapshot/mydumper sql) to TiDB cluster; to better match with full migration from MySQL/MariaDB database, TiDB also provides a data export tool, `dumpling`, which supports exporting full data as CSV/mydumper sql format;

    - Fast-initializing TiDB clusters: `TiDB Lightning` also provides the fast import feature, which can achieve the effect of fast initialization of specified tables of TiDB clusters. Before using this feature, you need to understand that the fast import period has a great impact on TiDB clusters, and the clusters are not available;

- Incremental data migration: To greatly reduce the downtime window during migration, it is recommended that you use DM to replicate Binlog from MySQL/MariaDB/Aurora to TiDB.

- TiDB Cluster Replication: To initialize a snapshot of TiDB to a new TiDB cluster, you can use the TiDB Backup & Restore (BR) tool.

## Data migration scenarios 

Depending on your source database, data size, and business requirements, the data migration solutions are different. This document provides the common data migration scenarios as follows to help you choose the most suitable solution.

### Migrate from Aurora/RDS to TiDB

To migrate data from Aurora/RDS to a TiDB cluster deployed in the same Cloud, it is recommended that data migration be done in two steps, full migration and incremental migration, using the Cloud storage service. Choose the appropriate step based on your needs.

In addition, given that Aurora/RDS and TiDB are deployed in different regions, even different Cloud Provider, the solution also includes a description of best practices for migrating data from different regions beforehand.

### Migrate from MySQL to TiDB

Without Cloud storage (S3) service, the network connectivity and latency between MySQL and TiDB are good, you can consider the following solution to migrate data from MySQL to TiDB

- One-Click Migration of MySQL Data to TiDB Tutorial

If you want the import to be fast enough or if the data size is very large (e.g. > 2T), and you allow the TiDB cluster offline during the migration, then you can use `TiDB Lightning` for a fast import of the full amount of data, and then use `DM` for incremental data (Binlog) replication depending on your needs

### Merge Shard Tables (on multiple MySQL) instance to TiDB

If your uses MySQL shard scheme and you want to merge all shard data into TiDB, you can use `DM` for shard merge migration.

- Shard merge migration to TiDB tutorial

If the total size of the shard table is very large (e.g.  > 2T) and allows the TiDB cluster offline during the migration, then you can use Lightning to perform a fast merge import of the full amount of shard data, and then choose to use `DM` for incremental shard data (Binlog) merge replication  according to needs

### Migrate to TiDB Cloud

If you want to use TiDB Cloud and migrate your current business to TiDB Cloud, then you can refer to the following tutorial

- Migrating across Clouds to TiDB Cloud
- Migrating to TiDB Cloud from IDC

### Restore a new TiDB Cluster

If you need to build a disaster recovery cluster or want to replicate a snapshot of your existing TiDB data to a new TiDB clusters for testing, then you can use BR to backup your existing cluster and then restore the backup data to a new cluster
