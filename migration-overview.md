# Migration Overview

This document describes scenarios for migrating data into TiDB from either MySQL or another data source via CSV format.

## Tools overview

Migrations will often make use of the following tools. The following is a brief overview of their usage:

- [`mydumper`](/mydumper-overview.md) exports data from MySQL. It is recommended over using mysqldump.
- [`loader`](/loader-overview.md) imports data in Mydumper format into TiDB.
- [`syncer`](/syncer-overview.md) acts like a MySQL replica and pushes data from MySQL into TiDB.
- [DM](https://pingcap.com/docs/tidb-data-migration/stable/overview/) (Data Migration) integrates the functions of Mydumper, Loader and syncer to support the export and import of full-size data, as well as incremental replication of MySQL Binlog data, and supports data replication of a more complete pooled table scenario.
- [TiDB Lightning](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-overview.md) imports data to TiDB in an optimized way. For example, a 1TiB backup could take 24+ hours to import with loader, while it will typically complete at least 3 times faster in TiDB Lightning.

## Scenarios

The following example scenarios show how you can put to use the tools mentioned above.

### Full data migration from MySQL

To migrate the full data, you can use one of the following three solutions:

- Mydumper + Loader: use Mydumper to export data from MySQL and use Loader to import the data into TiDB.
- Mydumper + TiDB Lightning: use Mydumper to export data from MySQL and use TiDB Lightning to import the data into TiDB.
- DM: use DM to export data from MySQL and import the data into TiDB.

For detailed operations, follow the steps in [Migrate Data from MySQL to TiDB](/migrate-full-data-from-mysql.md).

### Full data migration and incremental replication

To migrate the full data and then replicate data incrementally, you can use one of the following three solutions:

- Mydumper + Loader + Syncer: use Mydumper to export data from MySQL, use Loader to import the data into TiDB, and then use Syncer to replicate the incremental binlog data from MySQL into TiDB.
- Mydumper + TiDB Lightning + Syncer: use Mydumper to export data from MySQL, use TiDB Lightning to import the data into TiDB, and then use Syncer to replicate the incremental binlog data from MySQL into TiDB.
- DM: use DM to migrate the full data from MySQL to TiDB and then replicate the incremental data from MySQL into TiDB.

For detailed operations, follow the steps in [Incremental Migration](/migrate-incremental-data-from-mysql.md).

  > **Note:**
  >
  > To replicate data from MySQL to TiDB, binary logging [must be enabled](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-howto-masterbaseconfig.html) with the [row format](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/binary-log-formats.html) enabled.

### Dump and restore from database other than MySQL

To import data from another database, it is recommended to:

- Export the data as CSV format.
- Import the data using TiDB Lightning.

For more information, refer to [CSV support for TiDB Lightning](/tidb-lightning/migrate-from-csv-using-tidb-lightning.md).
