# Get Started with TiDB + AI via Python

This tutorial demonstrates how to develop a simple AI application that provides **semantic search** features. Unlike traditional keyword search, semantic search intelligently understands the meaning behind your query. For example, if you have documents titled "dog", "fish", and "tree", and you search for "a swimming animal", the application would identify "fish" as the most relevant result.

Throughout this tutorial, you will develop this AI application using [TiDB Vector Search](/tidb-cloud/vector-search-overview.md), Python, [TiDB Vector SDK for Python](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-vector-python), and AI models.

> **Note**
>
> TiDB Vector Search is currently in beta and only available for [TiDB Serverless](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-serverless) clusters.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need:

- [Python 3.8 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
- A TiDB Serverless cluster. Follow [creating a TiDB Serverless cluster](/tidb-cloud/create-tidb-cluster-serverless.md) to create your own TiDB Cloud cluster if you don't have one.

## Get started

To run the demo directly, check out the sample code in the [pingcap/tidb-vector-python](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-vector-python/blob/main/examples/python-client-quickstart) repository.

### Step 1. Create a new Python project

In your preferred directory, create a new Python project and a file named `example.py`:

```shell
mkdir python-client-quickstart
cd python-client-quickstart
touch example.py
```

### Step 2. Install required dependencies

In your project directory, run the following command to install the required packages:

```shell
pip install sqlalchemy pymysql sentence-transformers tidb-vector python-dotenv
```

- `tidb-vector`: the Python client for interacting with Vector Search in TiDB Cloud.
- [`sentence-transformers`](https://sbert.net): a Python library that provides pre-trained models for generating [vector embeddings](/tidb-cloud/vector-search-overview.md#vector-embedding) from text.

### Step 3. Configure the connection string to the TiDB cluster

1. Navigate to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page, and then click the name of your target cluster to go to its overview page.

2. Click **Connect** in the upper-right corner. A connection dialog is displayed.

3. Ensure the configurations in the connection dialog match your operating environment.

    - **Endpoint Type** is set to `Public`.
    - **Branch** is set to `main`.
    - **Connect With** is set to `SQLAlchemy`.
    - **Operating System** matches your environment.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > If your program is running in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), switch to the corresponding Linux distribution.

4. Click the **PyMySQL** tab and copy the connection string.

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > If you have not set a password yet, click **Generate Password** to generate a random password.

5. In the root directory of your Python project, create a `.env` file and paste the connection string into it.

    The following is an example for macOS:

    ```dotenv
    TIDB_DATABASE_URL="mysql+pymysql://<prefix>.root:<password>@gateway01.<region>.prod.aws.tidbcloud.com:4000/test?ssl_ca=/etc/ssl/cert.pem&ssl_verify_cert=true&ssl_verify_identity=true"
    ```

### Step 4. Initialize the embedding model

An [embedding model](/tidb-cloud/vector-search-overview.md#embedding-model) transforms data into [vector embeddings](/tidb-cloud/vector-search-overview.md#vector-embedding). This example uses the pre-trained model [**msmarco-MiniLM-L12-cos-v5**](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/msmarco-MiniLM-L12-cos-v5) for text embedding. This lightweight model, provided by the `sentence-transformers` library, transforms text data into 384-dimensional vector embeddings.

To set up the model, copy the following code into the `example.py` file. This code initializes a `SentenceTransformer` instance and defines a `text_to_embedding()` function for later use.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

print("Downloading and loading the embedding model...")
embed_model = SentenceTransformer("sentence-transformers/msmarco-MiniLM-L12-cos-v5", trust_remote_code=True)
embed_model_dims = embed_model.get_sentence_embedding_dimension()

def text_to_embedding(text):
    """Generates vector embeddings for the given text."""
    embedding = embed_model.encode(text)
    return embedding.tolist()
```

### Step 5. Connect to the TiDB cluster

Use the `TiDBVectorClient` class to connect to your TiDB cluster and create a table `embedded_documents` with a vector column to serve as the vector store.

> **Note**
>
> Ensure the dimension of your vector column matches the dimension of the vectors produced by your embedding model. For example, the **msmarco-MiniLM-L12-cos-v5** model generates vectors with 384 dimensions.

```python
import os
from tidb_vector.integrations import TiDBVectorClient
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load the connection string from the .env file
load_dotenv()

vector_store = TiDBVectorClient(
   # The table which will store the vector data.
   table_name='embedded_documents',
   # The connection string to the TiDB cluster.
   connection_string=os.environ.get('TIDB_DATABASE_URL'),
   # The dimension of the vector generated by the embedding model.
   vector_dimension=embed_model_dims,
   # Determine whether to recreate the table if it already exists.
   drop_existing_table=True,
)
```

### Step 6. Embed text data and store the vectors

In this step, you will prepare sample documents containing single words, such as "dog", "fish", and "tree". The following code uses the `text_to_embedding()` function to transform these text documents into vector embeddings, and then inserts them into the vector store.

```python
documents = [
    {
        "id": "f8e7dee2-63b6-42f1-8b60-2d46710c1971",
        "text": "dog",
        "embedding": text_to_embedding("dog"),
        "metadata": {"category": "animal"},
    },
    {
        "id": "8dde1fbc-2522-4ca2-aedf-5dcb2966d1c6",
        "text": "fish",
        "embedding": text_to_embedding("fish"),
        "metadata": {"category": "animal"},
    },
    {
        "id": "e4991349-d00b-485c-a481-f61695f2b5ae",
        "text": "tree",
        "embedding": text_to_embedding("tree"),
        "metadata": {"category": "plant"},
    },
]

vector_store.insert(
    ids=[doc["id"] for doc in documents],
    texts=[doc["text"] for doc in documents],
    embeddings=[doc["embedding"] for doc in documents],
    metadatas=[doc["metadata"] for doc in documents],
)
```

### Step 7. Perform semantic search

In this step, you will search for "a swimming animal", which doesn't directly match any words in existing documents.

The following code uses the `text_to_embedding()` function again to convert the query text into a vector embedding, and then queries with the embedding to find the top three closest matches.

```python
def print_result(query, result):
   print(f"Search result (\"{query}\"):")
   for r in result:
      print(f"- text: \"{r.document}\", distance: {r.distance}")

query = "a swimming animal"
query_embedding = text_to_embedding(query)
search_result = vector_store.query(query_embedding, k=3)
print_result(query, search_result)
```

Run the `example.py` file and the output is as follows:

```plain
Search result ("a swimming animal"):
- text: "fish", distance: 0.4562914811223072
- text: "dog", distance: 0.6469335836410557
- text: "tree", distance: 0.798545178640937
```

From the output, the swimming animal is most likely a fish, or a dog with a gift for swimming.

This demonstration shows how vector search can efficiently locate the most relevant documents, with search results organized by the proximity of the vectors: the smaller the distance, the more relevant the document.
