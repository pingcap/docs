# How to Run CH-benCHmark Test on TiDB

This document describes how to test TiDB using CH-benCHmark.

CH-benCHmark is a mixed workload containing both [TPC-C](http://www.tpc.org/tpcc/) and [TPC-H](http://www.tpc.org/tpch/) tests. It is the most common workload to test HTAP systems. For more information, see [The mixed workload CH-benCHmark](https://research.tableau.com/sites/default/files/a8-cole.pdf).

Before running the CH-benCHmark test, you need to deploy [TiFlash](/tiflash/tiflash-overview.md) first, which is a TiDB's HTAP component. After you deploy TiFlash and [create TiFlash replicas](#create-tiflash-replicas), TiKV will replicate the latest data of TPC-C online transactions to TiFlash in real time, and the TiDB optimizer will automatically push down OLAP queries from TPC-H workload to the MPP engine of TiFlash for efficient execution.

The CH-benCHmark test in this document is implemented based on [go-tpc](https://github.com/pingcap/go-tpc). You can download the test program using the following [TiUP](/tiup/tiup-overview.md) command:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
tiup install bench
```

For detailed usage of the TiUP Bench component, see [TiUP Bench](/tiup/tiup-bench.md).

## Load data

### Load TPC-C data

**Loading data is usually the most time-consuming and problematic stage of the entire TPC-C test.**

Taking 1000 warehouses as an example, you can execute the following TiUP command in shell for data load and test. Note that you need to replace `172.16.5.140` and `4000` in this document with your TiDB host and port values.

```shell
tiup bench tpcc -H 172.16.5.140 -P 4000 -D tpcc --warehouses 1000 prepare -T 32
```

Depending on different machine configurations, this loading process might take a few hours. If the cluster size is small, you can use a smaller warehouse value for the test.

After the data is loaded, you can execute the `tiup bench tpcc -H 172.16.5.140 -P 4000 -D tpcc --warehouses 1000 check` command to validate the data correctness.

### Load additional tables and views required for TPC-H

Run the following TiUP command in the shell:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
tiup bench ch -H 172.16.5.140 -P 4000 -D tpcc prepare
```

The following is the log output:

```
creating nation
creating region
creating supplier
generating nation table
generate nation table done
generating region table
generate region table done
generating suppliers table
generate suppliers table done
creating view revenue1
```

## Create TiFlash replicas

After TiFlash is deployed, TiFlash does not automatically replicate TiKV data. You need to execute the following SQL statement to create TiFlash replicas for the `tpcc` database. Once the specified TiFlash replicas are created, TiKV automatically replicates the latest data to TiFlash in real-time. In the following example, two TiFlash nodes are deployed in the cluster and the replica number is set to 2.

```
ALTER DATABASE tpcc SET tiflash replica 2;
```

To check whether the replication of all tables in the `tpcc` database is complete, execute the following statement, in which the `WHERE` clause is used to specify the databases and tables to be checked. If you want to check the replication status of all databases, remove the `WHERE` clause from the statement.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tiflash_replica WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'tpcc';
```

In the result of the above statement:

- `AVAILABLE` indicates whether the TiFlash replica of a specific table is available or not. `1` means available and `0` means unavailable. Once a replica becomes available, this status does not change anymore. If you use DDL statements to modify the number of replicas, the replication progress will be recalculated.
- `PROGRESS` means the progress of the replication. The value is between `0.0` and `1.0`. `1.0` means at least one replica is replicated.

## Collect statistics

To ensure that the TiDB optimizer can generate the optimal execution plan, execute the following SQL statements to collect statistics in advance.

```
analyze table customer;
analyze table district;
analyze table history;
analyze table item;
analyze table new_order;
analyze table order_line;
analyze table orders;
analyze table stock;
analyze table warehouse;
analyze table nation;
analyze table region;
analyze table supplier;
```

## Run the test

Taking 50 TP concurrency and 1 AP concurrency as an example, execute the following command to run the test:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
go-tpc ch --host 172.16.5.140 -P4000 --warehouses 1000 run -D tpcc -T 50 -t 1 --time 1h
```

During the test, test results are continuously printed on the console. For example:

After the test is finished, you can execute the `tiup bench tpcc -H 172.16.5.140 -P 4000 -D tpcc --warehouses 1000 check` command to validate the data correctness.
