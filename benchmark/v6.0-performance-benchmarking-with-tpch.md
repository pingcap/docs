# TiDB TPC-H Performance Test Report

TiDB v6.0 does not provide a performance test report for the MPP mode. To learn the performance comparison between TiDB MPP and other MPP systems or computing frameworks (Greeplum and Spark), refer to the [TiDB v5.4 TPC-H performance benchmarking report](/benchmark/v5.4-performance-benchmarking-with-tpch.md).
