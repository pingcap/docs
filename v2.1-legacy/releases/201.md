## TiDB

- Add the `tidb_auto_analyze_ratio` session variable to control the threshold value of automatic statistics update
- Fix an issue that not all residual states are cleaned up when the transaction commit fails
- Fix a bug about adding indexes in some conditions

- Add an option for TiDB to control the behaviour of Binlog failure

- Fix the issue that Learner still appears after it is closed
- Fix the issue that Regions fail to load because the packet size is too large

## TiKV

- Optimize the slow query log
- Reduce the number of `thread_yield` calls
- Fix the bug that raftstore is accidentally blocked when generating the snapshot
