# Character Set Configuration

Currently, TiDB only supports the `utf8` character set, which is the equivalent to `utf8mb4` in MySQL. Since MySQL 5.7 defaults to `latin1`, this difference is documented under [default differences](../sql/mysql-compatibility.md#default-differences) between TiDB and MySQL.

For more information, see [Character Set Configuration in MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/charset-configuration.html).
