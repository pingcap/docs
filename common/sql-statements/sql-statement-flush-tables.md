# FLUSH TABLES

This statement is included for compatibility with MySQL. It has no effective usage in TiDB.

## Synopsis

```ebnf+diagram
FlushStmt ::=
    'FLUSH' NoWriteToBinLogAliasOpt FlushOption

NoWriteToBinLogAliasOpt ::=
    ( 'NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG' | 'LOCAL' )?

FlushOption ::=
    'PRIVILEGES'
|   'STATUS'
|    'TIDB' 'PLUGINS' PluginNameList
|    'HOSTS'
|    LogTypeOpt 'LOGS'
|    TableOrTables TableNameListOpt WithReadLockOpt

LogTypeOpt ::=
    ( 'BINARY' | 'ENGINE' | 'ERROR' | 'GENERAL' | 'SLOW' )?

    'TABLE'
|   'TABLES'

    TableNameList?

```

## Examples

```sql
mysql> FLUSH TABLES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
ERROR 1105 (HY000): FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK is not supported.  Please use @@tidb_snapshot
```

## MySQL compatibility

* TiDB does not have a concept of table cache as in MySQL. Thus, `FLUSH TABLES` is parsed but ignored in TiDB for compatibility.
* The statement `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK` produces an error, as TiDB does not currently support locking tables. It is recommended to use [Historical reads](/read-historical-data.md) for this purpose instead.
