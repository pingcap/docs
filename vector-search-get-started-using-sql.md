# Get Started with Vector Search via SQL

TiDB extends MySQL syntax to support [Vector Search](/tidb-cloud/vector-search-overview.md) and introduce new [Vector data types](/tidb-cloud/vector-search-data-types.md) and several [vector functions](/tidb-cloud/vector-search-functions-and-operators.md).

This tutorial demonstrates how to get started with TiDB Vector Search just using SQL statements. You will learn how to use the [MySQL command-line client](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/mysql.html) to:

- Connect to your TiDB cluster.
- Create a vector table.
- Store vector embeddings.
- Perform vector search queries.

> **Note**
>
> TiDB Vector Search is currently in beta and only available for [TiDB Serverless](/tidb-cloud/select-cluster-tier.md#tidb-serverless) clusters.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need:

- [MySQL command-line client](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/mysql.html) (MySQL CLI) installed on your machine.
- A TiDB Serverless cluster. Follow [creating a TiDB Serverless cluster](/tidb-cloud/create-tidb-cluster-serverless.md) to create your own TiDB Cloud cluster if you don't have one.

## Get started

### Step 1. Connect to the TiDB cluster

1. Navigate to the [**Clusters**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/clusters) page, and then click the name of your target cluster to go to its overview page.

2. Click **Connect** in the upper-right corner. A connection dialog is displayed.

3. In the connection dialog, select **MySQL CLI** from the **Connect With** drop-down list and keep the default setting of the **Endpoint Type** as **Public**.

4. If you have not set a password yet, click **Generate Password** to generate a random password.

5. Copy the connection command and paste it into your terminal. The following is an example for macOS:

    ```bash
    mysql -u '<prefix>.root' -h '<host>' -P 4000 -D 'test' --ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY --ssl-ca=/etc/ssl/cert.pem -p'<password>'
    ```

### Step 2. Create a vector table

With vector search support, you can use the `VECTOR` type column to store [vector embeddings](/tidb-cloud/vector-search-overview.md#vector-embedding) in TiDB.

To create a table with a three-dimensional `VECTOR` column, execute the following SQL statements using your MySQL CLI:

```sql
USE test;
CREATE TABLE embedded_documents (
    id        INT       PRIMARY KEY,
    -- Column to store the original content of the document.
    document  TEXT,
    -- Column to store the vector representation of the document.
    embedding VECTOR(3)
);
```

The expected output is as follows:

```text
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.27 sec)
```

### Step 3. Store the vector embeddings

Insert three documents with their [vector embeddings](/tidb-cloud/vector-search-overview.md#vector-embedding) into the `embedded_documents` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO embedded_documents
VALUES
    (1, 'dog', '[1,2,1]'),
    (2, 'fish', '[1,2,4]'),
    (3, 'tree', '[1,0,0]');
```

The expected output is as follows:

```
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.15 sec)
Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

> **Note**
>
> This example simplifies the dimensions of the vector embeddings and uses only 3-dimensional vectors for demonstration purposes.
>
> In real-world applications, [embedding models](/tidb-cloud/vector-search-overview.md#embedding-model) often produce vector embeddings with hundreds or thousands of dimensions.

### Step 4. Query the vector table

To verify that the documents have been inserted correctly, query the `embedded_documents` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM embedded_documents;
```

The expected output is as follows:

```sql
+----+----------+-----------+
| id | document | embedding |
+----+----------+-----------+
|  1 | dog      | [1,2,1]   |
|  2 | fish     | [1,2,4]   |
|  3 | tree     | [1,0,0]   |
+----+----------+-----------+
3 rows in set (0.15 sec)
```

### Step 5. Perform a vector search query

Similar to full-text search, users provide search terms to the application when using vector search.

In this example, the search term is "a swimming animal", and its corresponding vector embedding is `[1,2,3]`. In practical applications, you need to use an embedding model to convert the user's search term into a vector embedding.

Execute the following SQL statement and TiDB will identify the top three documents closest to the search term by calculating and sorting the cosine distances (`vec_cosine_distance`) between the vector embeddings.

```sql
SELECT id, document, vec_cosine_distance(embedding, '[1,2,3]') AS distance
FROM embedded_documents
ORDER BY distance
LIMIT 3;
```

The expected output is as follows:

```plain
+----+----------+---------------------+
| id | document | distance            |
+----+----------+---------------------+
|  2 | fish     | 0.00853986601633272 |
|  1 | dog      | 0.12712843905603044 |
|  3 | tree     |  0.7327387580875756 |
+----+----------+---------------------+
3 rows in set (0.15 sec)
```

From the output, the swimming animal is most likely a fish, or a dog with a gift for swimming.
