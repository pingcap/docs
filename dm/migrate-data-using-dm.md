# Migrate Data Using Data Migration

This guide shows how to migrate data using the Data Migration (DM) tool.

## Step 1: Deploy the DM cluster

It is recommended to [deploy the DM cluster using TiUP](/dm/deploy-a-dm-cluster-using-tiup.md). You can also [deploy the DM cluster using binary](/dm/deploy-a-dm-cluster-using-binary.md) for trial or test.

> **Note:**
>
> - For database passwords in all the DM configuration files, it is recommended to use the passwords encrypted by `dmctl`. If a database password is empty, it is unnecessary to encrypt it. See [Encrypt the database password using dmctl](/dm/dm-manage-source.md#encrypt-the-database-password).
> - The user of the upstream and downstream databases must have the corresponding read and write privileges.

## Step 2: Check the cluster information

After the DM cluster is deployed using TiUP, the configuration information is like what is listed below.

- The configuration information of related components in the DM cluster:

    | Component | Host | Port |
    |------| ---- | ---- |
    | dm_worker1 | 172.16.10.72 | 8262 |
    | dm_worker2 | 172.16.10.73 | 8262 |
    | dm_master | 172.16.10.71 | 8261 |

- The information of upstream and downstream database instances:

    | Database instance | Host | Port | Username | Encrypted password |
    | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Upstream MySQL-1 | 172.16.10.81 | 3306 | root | VjX8cEeTX+qcvZ3bPaO4h0C80pe/1aU= |
    | Upstream MySQL-2 | 172.16.10.82 | 3306 | root | VjX8cEeTX+qcvZ3bPaO4h0C80pe/1aU= |
    | Downstream TiDB | 172.16.10.83 | 4000 | root | |

The list of privileges needed on the MySQL host can be found in the [precheck](/dm/dm-precheck.md) documentation.

## Step 3: Create data source

1. Write MySQL-1 related information to `conf/source1.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    # MySQL1 Configuration.

    source-id: "mysql-replica-01"
    # This indicates that whether DM-worker uses Global Transaction Identifier (GTID) to pull binlog. Before you use this configuration item, make sure that the GTID mode is enabled in the upstream MySQL.
    enable-gtid: false

    from:
      host: "172.16.10.81"
      user: "root"
      password: "VjX8cEeTX+qcvZ3bPaO4h0C80pe/1aU="
      port: 3306
    ```

2. Execute the following command in the terminal, and use `tiup dmctl` to load the MySQL-1 data source configuration to the DM cluster:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```bash
    tiup dmctl --master-addr 172.16.10.71:8261 operate-source create conf/source1.yaml
    ```

3. For MySQL-2, modify the relevant information in the configuration file and execute the same `dmctl` command.

## Step 4: Configure the data migration task

The following example assumes that you need to migrate all the `test_table` table data in the `test_db` database of both the upstream MySQL-1 and MySQL-2 instances, to the downstream `test_table` table in the `test_db` database of TiDB, in the full data plus incremental data mode.

Edit the `task.yaml` task configuration file as below:

```yaml
# The task name. You need to use a different name for each of the multiple tasks that
# run simultaneously.
name: "test"
# The full data plus incremental data (all) migration mode.
task-mode: "all"
# The downstream TiDB configuration information.
target-database:
  host: "172.16.10.83"
  port: 4000
  user: "root"
  password: ""

# Configuration of all the upstream MySQL instances required by the current data migration task.
mysql-instances:
-
  # The ID of upstream instances or the migration group. You can refer to the configuration of `source_id` in the "inventory.ini" file or in the "dm-master.toml" file.
  source-id: "mysql-replica-01"
  # The configuration item name of the block and allow lists of the name of the
  # database/table to be migrated, used to quote the global block and allow
  # lists configuration that is set in the global block-allow-list below.
  block-allow-list: "global"  # Use black-white-list if the DM version is earlier than or equal to v2.0.0-beta.2.
  # The configuration item name of the dump processing unit, used to quote the global configuration of the dump unit.
  mydumper-config-name: "global"

-
  source-id: "mysql-replica-02"
  block-allow-list: "global"  # Use black-white-list if the DM version is earlier than or equal to v2.0.0-beta.2.
  mydumper-config-name: "global"

# The global configuration of block and allow lists. Each instance can quote it by the
# configuration item name.
block-allow-list:                     # Use black-white-list if the DM version is earlier than or equal to v2.0.0-beta.2.
  global:
    do-tables:                        # The allow list of upstream tables to be migrated.
    - db-name: "test_db"              # The database name of the table to be migrated.
      tbl-name: "test_table"          # The name of the table to be migrated.

# The global configuration of the dump unit. Each instance can quote it by the configuration item name.
mydumpers:
  global:
    extra-args: ""
```

## Step 5: Start the data migration task

To detect possible errors of data migration configuration in advance, DM provides the precheck feature:

- DM automatically checks the corresponding privileges and configuration while starting the data migration task.
- You can also use the `check-task` command to manually precheck whether the upstream MySQL instance configuration satisfies the DM requirements.

For details about the precheck feature, see [Precheck the upstream MySQL instance configuration](/dm/dm-precheck.md).

> **Note:**
>
> Before starting the data migration task for the first time, you should have got the upstream configured. Otherwise, an error is reported while you start the task.

Run the `tiup dmctl` command to start the data migration tasks. `task.yaml` is the configuration file that is edited above.

{{< copyable "" >}}

```bash
tiup dmctl --master-addr 172.16.10.71:8261 start-task ./task.yaml
```

- If the above command returns the following result, it indicates the task is successfully started.

    ```json
    {
        "result": true,
        "msg": "",
        "workers": [
            {
                "result": true,
                "worker": "172.16.10.72:8262",
                "msg": ""
            },
            {
                "result": true,
                "worker": "172.16.10.73:8262",
                "msg": ""
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

- If you fail to start the data migration task, modify the configuration according to the returned prompt and then run the `start-task task.yaml` command to restart the task.

## Step 6: Check the data migration task

If you need to check the task state or whether a certain data migration task is running in the DM cluster, run the following command in `tiup dmctl`:

{{< copyable "" >}}

```bash
tiup dmctl --master-addr 172.16.10.71:8261 query-status
```

## Step 7: Stop the data migration task

If you do not need to migrate data any more, run the following command in `tiup dmctl` to stop the task:

```bash
tiup dmctl --master-addr 172.16.10.71:8261 stop-task test
```

`test` is the task name that you set in the `name` configuration item of the `task.yaml` configuration file.

## Step 8: Monitor the task and check logs

Assuming that Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana are successfully deployed along with the DM cluster deployment using TiUP, and the Grafana address is `172.16.10.71`. To view the alert information related to DM, you can open <http://172.16.10.71:9093> in a browser and enter into Alertmanager; to check monitoring metrics, go to <http://172.16.10.71:3000>, and choose the DM dashboard.

While the DM cluster is running, DM-master, DM-worker, and dmctl output the monitoring metrics information through logs. The log directory of each component is as follows:

- DM-master log directory: It is specified by the `--log-file` DM-master process parameter. If DM is deployed using TiUP, the log directory is `{log_dir}` in the DM-master node.
- DM-worker log directory: It is specified by the `--log-file` DM-worker process parameter. If DM is deployed using TiUP, the log directory is `{log_dir}` in the DM-worker node.
