title: DM Advanced Task Configuration File
aliases: ['/docs/tidb-data-migration/dev/task-configuration-file-full/','/docs/tidb-data-migration/dev/dm-portal/']
summary: This document introduces the advanced task configuration file of Data Migration (DM), covering global and instance configuration. The global configuration includes basic and feature settings, while the instance configuration defines subtasks for data migration from one or multiple MySQL instances in the upstream to the same instance in the downstream.

# DM Advanced Task Configuration File

This document introduces the advanced task configuration file of Data Migration (DM), including [global configuration](#global-configuration) and [instance configuration](#instance-configuration).

## Important concepts

For description of important concepts including `source-id` and the DM-worker ID, see [Important concepts](/dm/dm-config-overview.md#important-concepts).

## Task configuration file template (advanced)

The following is the task configuration file template which allows you to perform **advanced** data migration tasks.

```yaml
---

# ----------- Global configuration -----------
## ********* Basic configuration *********
name: test                      # The name of the task. Should be globally unique.
task-mode: all                  # The task mode. Can be set to `full`(only migrates full data)/`incremental`(replicates binlogs synchronously)/`all` (replicates both full data and incremental binlogs).
shard-mode: "pessimistic"       # The shard merge mode. Optional modes are ""/"pessimistic"/"optimistic". The "" mode is used by default which means sharding DDL merge is disabled. If the task is a shard merge task, set it to the "pessimistic" mode.
                                # After understanding the principles and restrictions of the "optimistic" mode, you can set it to the "optimistic" mode.
strict-optimistic-shard-mode: false # Only takes effect in the optimistic mode. This configuration restricts the behavior of the optimistic mode. The default value is false. Introduced in v7.2.0. For details, see https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.2/feature-shard-merge-optimistic
meta-schema: "dm_meta"          # The downstream database that stores the `meta` information.
timezone: "Asia/Shanghai"       # The timezone used in SQL Session. By default, DM uses the global timezone setting in the target cluster, which ensures the correctness automatically. A customized timezone does not affect data migration but is unnecessary.
case-sensitive: false           # Determines whether the schema/table is case-sensitive.
online-ddl: true                # Supports automatic processing of upstream "gh-ost" and "pt".
online-ddl-scheme: "gh-ost"     # `online-ddl-scheme` is deprecated, so it is recommended to use `online-ddl`.
clean-dump-file: true           # Whether to clean up the files generated during data dump. Note that these include `metadata` files.
collation_compatible: "loose"   # The mode to sync the default collation in `CREATE` SQL statements. The supported values are "loose" (by default) or "strict". When the value is "strict", DM explicitly appends the corresponding collation of the upstream to the SQL statements; when the value is "loose", DM does not modify the SQL statements. In "strict" mode, if the downstream does not support the default collation in the upstream, the downstream might report an error.
ignore-checking-items: []       # Ignorable checking items. For the complete list of ignorable checking items, see DM precheck: https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/dm-precheck#ignorable-checking-items.

target-database:                # Configuration of the downstream database instance.
  host: "192.168.0.1"
  port: 4000
  user: "root"
  password: "/Q7B9DizNLLTTfiZHv9WoEAKamfpIUs="  # It is recommended to use a password encrypted with `dmctl encrypt`.
  max-allowed-packet: 67108864                  # Sets the "max_allowed_packet" limit of the TiDB client (that is, the limit of the maximum accepted packet) when DM internally connects to the TiDB server. The unit is bytes. (67108864 by default)
                                                # Since DM v2.0.0, this configuration item is deprecated, and DM automatically obtains the "max_allowed_packet" value from TiDB.
  session:                                       # The session variables of TiDB, supported since v1.0.6. For details, go to `https://pingcap.com/docs/stable/system-variables`.
    sql_mode: "ANSI_QUOTES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE" # Since DM v2.0.0, if this item does not appear in the configuration file, DM automatically fetches a proper value for "sql_mode" from the downstream TiDB. Manual configuration of this item has a higher priority.
    tidb_skip_utf8_check: 1                     # Since DM v2.0.0, if this item does not appear in the configuration file, DM automatically fetches a proper value for "tidb_skip_utf8_check" from the downstream TiDB. Manual configuration of this item has a higher priority.
    tidb_constraint_check_in_place: 0
    sql_require_primary_key: OFF                # Controls whether a table must have a primary key at the session level. During the creation of a DM task, several metadata tables are created in TiDB, and some of them have no primary key. If this parameter is enabled, these metadata tables without primary keys cannot be created, which will cause DM to fail to create the task. In this case, you need to set this parameter to `OFF`.
  security:                       # The TLS configuration of the downstream TiDB
    ssl-ca: "/path/to/ca.pem"
    ssl-cert: "/path/to/cert.pem"

    # The directory that stores full data exported from the upstream ("./dumped_data" by default).
    # Supoprts a local filesystem path or an Amazon S3 path. For example, "s3://dm_bucket/dumped_data?endpoint=s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com&access_key=s3accesskey&secret_access_key=s3secretkey&force_path_style=true"
    dir: "./dumped_data"

    # The import mode during the full import phase. The following modes are supported:
    # - "logical" (default). Uses TiDB Lightning's logical import mode to import data. Document: https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/tidb-lightning-logical-import-mode
    # - "physical". Uses TiDB Lightning's physical import mode to import data. Document: https://docs.pingcap.com/zh/tidb/stable/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode
    #   The "physical" mode is still an experimental feature and is not recommended in production.
    import-mode: "logical"
    #  Methods to resolve conflicts in logical import.
    # - "replace" (default). Uses the new data to replace the existing data.
    # - "ignore". Keeps the existing data, and ignores the new data.
    # - "error". Reports errors when inserting duplicated data, and then stops the replication task.
    on-duplicate-logical: "replace"

    #  Methods to resolve conflicts in physical import.
    # - "none". Corresponds to the "none" strategy of conflict detection in TiDB Lightning's physical import.
    #   (https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode-usage#conflict-detection).
    #   Conflicting data is not resolved in this method. "none" has the best performance, but
    #   might lead to inconsistent data in the downstream database.
    # - "manual". Corresponds to the "remove" strategy of conflict detection in TiDB Lightning's physical import.
    #   (https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode-usage#conflict-detection).
    #   When the import encounter conflicting data, DM removes all conflicting records from
    #   the target table and records the data in the `${meta-schema}_${name}.conflict_error_v1`
    #   table. In this configuration file, the conflicting data is recorded in the
    #   `dm_meta_test.conflict_error_v1` table. When the full import phase is completed, the
    #   tasks is paused and you are prompted to query this table and manually resolve the
    #   conflicts. You need to resume the task and enter the incremental phase using the `resume-task` command.
    on-duplicate-physical: "none"
    # The directory used for local KV sorting in the physical import mode. The default value of this
    # configuration is the same as the `dir` configuration. For details, refer to TiDB Lightning document: https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode#environment-requirements
    sorting-dir-physical: "./dumped_data"
    # Disk quota. Corresponds to the disk-quota configuration of TiDB Lightning. For details, refer to TiDB Lightning document: https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode-usage#configure-disk-quota-new-in-v620
    disk-quota-physical: "0"
    # DM performs `ADMIN CHECKSUM TABLE <table>` for each table to verify data integrity after the import.
    # - "required" (default): performs admin checksum after the import. If checksum fails,
    #   DM pauses the task and you need to manually handle the failure.
    # - "optional": performs admin checksum after the import. If checksum fails, DM logs a
    #   warning and continues to migrate data. The task is not paused.
    # - "off": does not perform admin checksum after the import.
    # If checksum fails, the import is abnormal, which means the data is inconsistent or lost.
    # Therefore, it is recommended to always enable checksum.
    checksum-physical: "required"
    # Only available for physical import. Determines whether to perform the `ANALYZE TABLE <table>` operation for each table after the CHECKSUM process is completed.
    # - "required" (default). Indicates that the Analyze operation will be performed after the import is complete. If the analysis fails, the task will pause and require manual processing by the user.
    # - "optional". Indicates that the data will be analyzed after the import is complete. If the analysis fails, a warning log will be printed and the task will not be paused.
    # - "off". Indicates that no data analysis will be performed after the import is complete.
    # Analyze only affects statistics data and it is recommended that Analyze is set to off in most scenarios.
    analyze: "off"
    # Only available for physical import. The concurrency of sending KV data to TiKV. This can be increased when the direct network transfer speed between dm-worker and TiKV exceeds 10,000 Mb/s.
    # range-concurrency: 16
    # Only available for physical import mode. Whether to enable compression when sending KV data to TiKV. Currently, only Gzip compression is supported and can be specified using either "gzip" or "gz". Compression is not enabled by default.

    # If set to true, `INSERT` statements from upstream are rewritten to `REPLACE` statements, and `UPDATE` statements are rewritten to `DELETE` and `REPLACE` statements. This ensures that DML statements can be imported repeatedly during data migration when there is any primary key or unique index in the table schema.
    safe-mode: false
    # The duration of the automatic safe mode.
    # If this value is not set or set to "", the default value is twice of `checkpoint-flush-interval` (30s by default), which is 60s.
    # If this value is set to "0s", DM reports an error when it automatically enters the safe mode.
    # If this value is set to a normal value, such as "1m30s", when the task pauses abnormally, when DM fails to
    # record safemode_exit_point, or when DM exits unexpectedly, the duration of the automatic safe mode is set to
    # 1 minute 30 seconds.
    safe-mode-duration: "60s"

    # If set to true, DM compacts as many upstream statements on the same rows as possible into a single statements without increasing latency.
    # For example, `INSERT INTO tb(a,b) VALUES(1,1); UPDATE tb SET b=11 WHERE a=1`;` will be compacted to `INSERT INTO tb(a,b) VALUES(1,11);`, where "a" is the primary key

    # For example, `INSERT INTO tb(a,b) VALUES(1,1); INSERT INTO tb(a,b) VALUES(2,2);` will become `INSERT INTO tb(a,b) VALUES(1,1),(2,2);`
    # `UPDATE tb SET b=11 WHERE a=1; UPDATE tb(a,b) set b=22 WHERE a=2;` will become `INSERT INTO tb(a,b) VALUES(1,11),(2,22) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE a=VALUES(a), b= VALUES(b);`, where "a" is the primary key
    # `DELETE FROM tb WHERE a=1; DELETE FROM tb WHERE a=2` will become `DELETE FROM tb WHERE (a) IN (1),(2)`, where "a" is the primary key

```

## Configuration order

From the sample configuration file, you can see that the configuration file contains two parts: `Global configuration` and `Instance configuration`, where the `Global configuration` contains `Basic configuration` and `Feature configuration set`. The configuration order is as follows:

1. Edit the [global configuration](#global-configuration).
2. Edit the [instance configuration](#instance-configuration) based on the global configuration.

## Global configuration

### Basic configuration

Refer to the comments in the [template](#task-configuration-file-template-advanced) to see more details. Detailed explanations about `task-mode` are as follows:

- Description: the task mode that can be used to specify the data migration task to be executed.
- Value: string (`full`, `incremental`, or `all`).
    - `full` only makes a full backup of the upstream database and then imports the full data to the downstream database.
    - `incremental`: Only replicates the incremental data of the upstream database to the downstream database using the binlog. You can set the `meta` configuration item of the instance configuration to specify the starting position of incremental replication.
    - `all`: `full` + `incremental`. Makes a full backup of the upstream database, imports the full data to the downstream database, and then uses the binlog to make an incremental replication to the downstream database starting from the exported position during the full backup process (binlog position).

### Feature configuration set

Arguments in each feature configuration set are explained in the comments in the [template](#task-configuration-file-template-advanced).

| Parameter        | Description                                    |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
| `routes` | The routing mapping rule set between the upstream and downstream tables. If the names of the upstream and downstream schemas and tables are the same, this item does not need to be configured. See [Table Routing](/dm/dm-table-routing.md) for usage scenarios and sample configurations. |
| `filters` | The binlog event filter rule set of the matched table of the upstream database instance. If binlog filtering is not required, this item does not need to be configured. See [Binlog Event Filter](/dm/dm-binlog-event-filter.md) for usage scenarios and sample configurations. |
| `block-allow-list` | The filter rule set of the block allow list of the matched table of the upstream database instance.
