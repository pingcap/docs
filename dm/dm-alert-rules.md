# DM Alert Information

The [alert system](/dm/migrate-data-using-dm.md#step-8-monitor-the-task-and-check-logs) is deployed by default when you deploy a DM cluster using TiUP.

For more information about DM alert rules and the solutions, refer to [handle alerts](/dm/dm-handle-alerts.md).

Both DM alert information and monitoring metrics are based on Prometheus. For more information about their relationship, refer to [DM monitoring metrics](/dm/monitor-a-dm-cluster.md).
