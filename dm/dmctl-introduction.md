# Maintain DM Clusters Using dmctl

> **Note:**
>
> For DM clusters deployed using TiUP, you are recommended to directly use [`tiup dmctl`](/dm/maintain-dm-using-tiup.md#dmctl) to maintain the clusters.

dmctl is a command line tool used to maintain DM clusters. It supports both the interactive mode and the command mode.

## Interactive mode

Enter the interactive mode to interact with DM-master:

> **Note:**
>
> The interactive mode does not support Bash features. For example, you need to directly pass string flags instead of passing them in quotes.

```bash
./dmctl --master-addr 172.16.30.14:8261
```

```

## Command mode

The command mode differs from the interactive mode in that you need to append the task operation right after the dmctl command. The parameters of the task operation in the command mode are the same as those in the interactive mode.

> **Note:**
>
> + A dmctl command must be followed by only one task operation.
> + Starting from v2.0.4, DM supports reading the `-master-addr` parameter from the environment variable `DM_MASTER_ADDR`.
