# Data Migration Relay Log

The Data Migration (DM) relay log consists of several sets of numbered files containing events that describe database changes, and an index file that contains the names of all used relay log files.

After relay log is enabled, DM-worker automatically migrates the upstream binlog to the local configuration directory (the default migration directory is `<deploy_dir>/<relay_log>` if DM is deployed using TiUP). The default value of `<relay_log>` is `relay-dir` and can be modified in [Upstream Database Configuration File](/dm/dm-source-configuration-file.md). Since v5.4.0, you can configure the local configuration directory through `relay-dir` in the [DM-worker configuration file](/dm/dm-worker-configuration-file.md), which takes precedence over the configuration file of the upstream database.

> **Warning:**
>
> `relay-dir` in the upstream database configuration file is marked as deprecated in v6.1 and might be removed in a future release. You can see the following prompt in the output of the relevant command: `` `relay-dir` in source config will be deprecated soon, please use `relay-dir` in worker config instead``.

When DM-worker is running, it migrates the upstream binlog to the local file in real time. The sync processing unit of DM-worker, reads the binlog events of the local relay log in real time, transforms these events to SQL statements, and then migrates these statements to the downstream database.

This document introduces the directory structure and initial migration rules DM relay logs, and how to pause, resume, and purge relay logs.

> **Note:**
>
> The relay log feature requires additional disk I/O operations, resulting in higher latency of data migration. If the disk I/O performance in the deployment environment is poor, the relay log feature may become a bottleneck of the migration task and thus slows the migration.

## Directory structure

An example of the directory structure of the local storage for a relay log:

```
<deploy_dir>/<relay_log>/
|-- 7e427cc0-091c-11e9-9e45-72b7c59d52d7.000001
|   |-- mysql-bin.000001
|   |-- mysql-bin.000002
|   |-- mysql-bin.000003
|   |-- mysql-bin.000004
|   `-- relay.meta
|-- 842965eb-091c-11e9-9e45-9a3bff03fa39.000002
|   |-- mysql-bin.000001
|   `-- relay.meta
`-- server-uuid.index
```

- `subdir`:

    - DM-worker stores the binlog migrated from the upstream database in the same directory. Each directory is a `subdir`.

    - `subdir` is named `<Upstream database UUID>.<Local subdir serial number>`.

    - After a switch between primary and secondary instances in the upstream, DM-worker generates a new `subdir` directory with an incremental serial number.

        - In the above example, for the `7e427cc0-091c-11e9-9e45-72b7c59d52d7.000001` directory, `7e427cc0-091c-11e9-9e45-72b7c59d52d7` is the upstream database UUID and `000001` is the local `subdir` serial number.

- `server-uuid.index`: Records a list of names of currently available `subdir` directory.

- `relay.meta`: Stores the information of the migrated binlog in each `subdir`. For example,

    ```bash
    $ cat c0149e17-dff1-11e8-b6a8-0242ac110004.000001/relay.meta
    binlog-name = "mysql-bin.000010"                            # The name of the currently migrated binlog.
    binlog-pos = 63083620                                       # The position of the currently migrated binlog.
    binlog-gtid = "c0149e17-dff1-11e8-b6a8-0242ac110004:1-3328" # GTID of the currently migrated binlog.
                                                                # There might be multiple GTIDs.
    $ cat 92acbd8a-c844-11e7-94a1-1866daf8accc.000001/relay.meta
    binlog-name = "mysql-bin.018393"
    binlog-pos = 277987307
    binlog-gtid = "3ccc475b-2343-11e7-be21-6c0b84d59f30:1-14,406a3f61-690d-11e7-87c5-6c92bf46f384:1-94321383,53bfca22-690d-11e7-8a62-18ded7a37b78:1-495,686e1ab6-c47e-11e7-a42c-6c92bf46f384:1-34981190,03fc0263-28c7-11e7-a653-6c0b84d59f30:1-7041423,05474d3c-28c7-11e7-8352-203db246dd3d:1-170,10b039fc-c843-11e7-8f6a-1866daf8d810:1-308290454"
    ```

## Initial migration rules

The starting position of the relay log migration is determined by the following rules:

- From the checkpoint of the downstream sync unit, DM firstly gets the earliest position from which the migration tasks need to replicate from the data source. If the position is later than any of the following positions, DM-worker starts the migration from this position.

- If a valid local relay log exists (a valid relay log is a relay log with valid `server-uuid.index`, `subdir` and `relay.meta` files), DM-worker resumes migration from a position recorded by `relay.meta`.

- If a valid local relay log does not exist, but `relay-binlog-name` or `relay-binlog-gtid` is specified in the source configuration file:

    - In the non-GTID mode, if `relay-binlog-name` is specified, DM-worker starts migration from the specified binlog file.
    - In the GTID mode, if `relay-binlog-gtid` is specified, DM-worker starts migration from the specified GTID.

- If a valid local relay log does not exist, and `relay-binlog-name` or `relay-binlog-gtid` is not specified in the DM configuration file:

    - In the non-GTID mode, DM-worker starts migration from the initial upstream binlog and migrates all the upstream binlog files to the latest successively.

    - In the GTID mode, DM-worker starts migration from the initial upstream GTID.

        > **Note:**
        >
        > If the upstream relay log is purged, an error occurs. In this case, set `relay-binlog-gtid` to specify the starting position of migration.

## Start and stop the relay log feature

<SimpleTab>

<div label="v5.4.0 and later versions">

In v5.4.0 and later versions, you can enable relay log by setting `enable-relay` to `true`. Since v5.4.0, when binding the upstream data source, DM-worker checks the `enable-relay` item in the configuration of the data source. If `enable-relay` is `true`, the relay log feature is enabled for this data source.

For the detailed configuration method, see [Upstream Database Configuration File](/dm/dm-source-configuration-file.md).

In addition, you can also dynamically adjust the `enable-relay` configuration of the data source using the `start-relay` or `stop-relay` command to enable or disable relay log in time.

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```bash
» start-relay -s mysql-replica-01
```

```
{
    "result": true,
    "msg": ""
}
```

</div>

<div label="versions between v2.0.2 (included) and v5.3.0 (included)">

> **Note:**
>
> In DM v2.0.x later than DM v2.0.2 and in v5.3.0, the configuration item `enable-relay` in the source configuration file is no longer valid, and you can only use `start-relay` and `stop-relay` to enable and disable relay log. If DM finds that `enable-relay` is set to `true` when [loading the data source configuration](/dm/dm-manage-source.md#operate-data-source), it outputs the following message:
>
> ```
> Please use `start-relay` to specify which workers should pull relay log of relay-enabled sources.
> ```

> **Warning:**
>
> This startup method is marked as deprecated in v6.1 and might be removed in a future release. You can see the following prompt in the output of the relevant command: `start-relay/stop-relay with worker name will be deprecated soon. You can try stopping relay first and use start-relay without worker name instead`.

In the command `start-relay`, you can configure one or more DM-workers to migrate relay logs for the specified data source, but the DM-workers specified in the parameter must be free or have been bound to the upstream data source. Examples are as follows:

{{< copyable "" >}}

```bash
» start-relay -s mysql-replica-01 worker1 worker2
```

```
{
    "result": true,
    "msg": ""
}
```

{{< copyable "" >}}

```bash
» stop-relay -s mysql-replica-01 worker1 worker2
```

```
{
    "result": true,
    "msg": ""
}
```

</div>

<div label="earlier than v2.0.2">

In DM versions earlier than v2.0.2 (not including v2.0.2), DM checks the configuration item `enable-relay` in the source configuration file when binding a DM-worker to an upstream data source. If `enable-relay` is set to `true`, DM enables the relay log feature for the data source.

See [Upstream Database Configuration File](/dm/dm-source-configuration-file.md) for how to set the configuration item `enable-relay`.

</div>
</SimpleTab>

## Query relay logs

You can use the command `query-status -s` to query the status of the relay log pulling process of an upstream data source. See the following example:

{{< copyable "" >}}

```bash
» query-status -s mysql-replica-01
```

```
{
    "result": true,
    "msg": "",
    "sources": [
        {
            "result": true,
            "msg": "no sub task started",
            "sourceStatus": {
                "source": "mysql-replica-01",
                "worker": "worker2",
                "result": null,
                "relayStatus": {
                    "masterBinlog": "(mysql-bin.000005, 916)",
                    "masterBinlogGtid": "09bec856-ba95-11ea-850a-58f2b4af5188:1-28",
                    "relaySubDir": "09bec856-ba95-11ea-850a-58f2b4af5188.000001",
                    "relayBinlog": "(mysql-bin.000005, 4)",
                    "relayBinlogGtid": "09bec856-ba95-11ea-850a-58f2b4af5188:1-28",
                    "relayCatchUpMaster": false,
                    "stage": "Running",
                    "result": null
                }
            },
            "subTaskStatus": [
            ]
        },
        {
            "result": true,
            "msg": "no sub task started",
            "sourceStatus": {
                "source": "mysql-replica-01",
                "worker": "worker1",
                "result": null,
                "relayStatus": {
                    "masterBinlog": "(mysql-bin.000005, 916)",
                    "masterBinlogGtid": "09bec856-ba95-11ea-850a-58f2b4af5188:1-28",
                    "relaySubDir": "09bec856-ba95-11ea-850a-58f2b4af5188.000001",
                    "relayBinlog": "(mysql-bin.000005, 916)",
                    "relayBinlogGtid": "",
                    "relayCatchUpMaster": true,
                    "stage": "Running",
                    "result": null
                }
            },
            "subTaskStatus": [
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Pause and resume the relay log feature

You can use the command `pause-relay` to pause the pulling process of relay logs and use the command `resume-relay` to resume the process. You need to specify the `source-id` of the upstream data source when executing these two commands. See the following examples:

{{< copyable "" >}}

```bash
» pause-relay -s mysql-replica-01 -s mysql-replica-02
```

```
{
    "op": "PauseRelay",
    "result": true,
    "msg": "",
    "sources": [
        {
            "result": true,
            "msg": "",
            "source": "mysql-replica-01",
            "worker": "worker1"
        },
        {
            "result": true,
            "msg": "",
            "source": "mysql-replica-02",
            "worker": "worker2"
        }
    ]
}
```

{{< copyable "" >}}

```bash
» resume-relay -s mysql-replica-01
```

```
{
    "op": "ResumeRelay",
    "result": true,
    "msg": "",
    "sources": [
        {
            "result": true,
            "msg": "",
            "source": "mysql-replica-01",
            "worker": "worker1"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Purge relay logs

Through the detection mechanism of reading and writing files, DM-worker does not purge the relay log that is being used or will be used later by the currently running data migration task.

The data purge methods for the relay log include automatic purge and manual purge.

### Automatic data purge

You can enable automatic data purge and configure its strategy in the source configuration file. See the following example:

```yaml
# relay log purge strategy
purge:
    interval: 3600
    expires: 24
    remain-space: 15
```

+ `purge.interval`
    - The interval of automatic purge in the background, in seconds.
    - "3600" by default, indicating a background purge task is performed every 3600 seconds.

+ `purge.expires`
    - The number of hours for which the relay log (that has been previously written to the relay processing unit, and that is not being used or will not be read later by the currently running data migration task) can be retained before being purged in the automatic background purge.
    - "0" by default, indicating data purge is not performed according to the update time of the relay log.

+ `purge.remain-space`
    - The amount of remaining disk space in GB less than which the specified DM-worker machine tries to purge the relay log that can be purged securely in the automatic background purge. If it is set to `0`, data purge is not performed according to the remaining disk space.
    - "15" by default, indicating when the available disk space is less than 15GB, DM-master tries to purge the relay log securely.

### Manual data purge

Manual data purge means using the `purge-relay` command provided by dmctl to specify `subdir` and the binlog name thus to purge all the relay logs **before** the specified binlog. If the `-subdir` option in the command is not specified, all relay logs **before** the current relay log sub-directory are purged.

Assuming that the directory structure of the current relay log is as follows:

```
$ tree .
.
|-- deb76a2b-09cc-11e9-9129-5242cf3bb246.000001

deb76a2b-09cc-11e9-9129-5242cf3bb246.000003
```

+ Executing the following `purge-relay` command in dmctl purges all relay log files **before** `e4e0e8ab-09cc-11e9-9220-82cc35207219.000002/mysql-bin.000001`, which is all relay log files in `deb76a2b-09cc-11e9-9129-5242cf3bb246.000001`.

    {{< copyable "" >}}

    ```bash
    » purge-relay -s mysql-replica-01 --filename mysql-bin.000001 --sub-dir e4e0e8ab-09cc-11e9-9220-82cc35207219.000002
    ```

+ Executing the following `purge-relay` command in dmctl purges all relay log file **before the current** (`deb76a2b-09cc-11e9-9129-5242cf3bb246.000003`) directory's `mysql-bin.000001`, which is all relay log files in `deb76a2b-09cc-11e9-9129-5242cf3bb246.000001` and `e4e0e8ab-09cc-11e9-9220-82cc35207219.000002`.

    {{< copyable "" >}}

    ```bash
    » purge-relay -s mysql-replica-01 --filename mysql-bin.000001
    ```
