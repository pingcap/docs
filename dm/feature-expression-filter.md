# Filter DMLs Using SQL Expressions

## Overview

In the process of incremental data migration, you can filter certain types of binlog events using the [Filter Binlog Events](/filter-binlog-event.md) feature. For example, for archiving or auditing purposes, you can filter out `DELETE` events when migrating data to the downstream. However, Binlog Event Filter cannot judge with a greater granularity on whether to filter out a specific row of `DELETE` events.

To solve the above issue, DM supports filtering data during incremental migration using `binlog value filter` since v2.0.5. The binlog in the `ROW` format supported by DM has the values of all columns in binlog events. You can configure SQL expressions according to these values. If the SQL expressions evaluate a row change as `TRUE`, DM will not migrate the row change downstream.

For detailed operation and implementation, see [Filter DML Events Using SQL Expressions](/filter-dml-event.md).
