# TiDB Data Migration Binlog Event Filter

TiDB Data Migration (DM) provides the binlog event filter feature to filter out or only receive specified types of binlog events for some schemas or tables. For example, you can filter out all `TRUNCATE TABLE` or `INSERT` events. The binlog event filter feature is more fine-grained than the [block and allow lists](/dm/dm-block-allow-table-lists.md) feature.

## Configure the binlog event filter

In the task configuration file, add the following configuration:

```yaml
filters:
  rule-1:
    schema-pattern: "test_*"
    ​table-pattern: "t_*"
    ​events: ["truncate table", "drop table"]
    sql-pattern: ["^DROP\\s+PROCEDURE", "^CREATE\\s+PROCEDURE"]
    ​action: Ignore
```

Starting from DM v2.0.2, you can configure the binlog event filter in the source configuration file. For details, see [Upstream Database Configuration File](/dm/dm-source-configuration-file.md).

In simple scenarios, it is recommended that you use the wildcard for matching schemas and tables. However, note the following version differences:

- For DM v1.0.5 or later versions, the binlog event filter supports the [wildcard match](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)#Syntax), but there can be **only one** `*` in the wildcard expression, and `*` **must be placed at the end**.

- For DM versions earlier than v1.0.5, the binlog event filter supports the wildcard but does not support the `[...]` and `[!...]` expressions.

## Parameter descriptions

- [`schema-pattern`/`table-pattern`](/dm/table-selector.md): the binlog events or DDL SQL statements of upstream MySQL or MariaDB instance tables that match `schema-pattern`/`table-pattern` are filtered by the rules below.

- `events`: the binlog event array. You can only select one or more `Event`s from the following table:

    | Events            | Type | Description                   |
    | ---------------   | ---- | ----------------------------- |
    | `all`             |      | Includes all the events below |
    | `all dml`         |      | Includes all DML events below |
    | `all ddl`         |      | Includes all DDL events below |
    | `none`            |      | Includes none of the events below |
    | `none ddl`        |      | Includes none of the DDL events below |
    | `none dml`        |      | Includes none of the DML events below |
    | `insert`          | DML  | The `INSERT` DML event              |
    | `update`          | DML  | The `UPDATE` DML event              |
    | `delete`          | DML  | The `DELETE` DML event              |
    | `create database` | DDL  | The `CREATE DATABASE` DDL event         |
    | `drop database`   | DDL  | The `DROP DATABASE` DDL event           |
    | `create table`    | DDL  | The `CREATE TABLE` DDL event      |
    | `create index`    | DDL  | The `CREATE INDEX` DDL event          |
    | `drop table`      | DDL  | The `DROP TABLE` DDL event              |
    | `truncate table`  | DDL  | The `TRUNCATE TABLE` DDL event          |
    | `rename table`    | DDL  | The `RENAME TABLE` DDL event            |
    | `drop index`      | DDL  | The `DROP INDEX` DDL event           |
    | `alter table`     | DDL  | The `ALTER TABLE` DDL event           |

- `sql-pattern`: it is used to filter specified DDL SQL statements. The matching rule supports using a regular expression. For example, `"^DROP\\s+PROCEDURE"`.

- `action`: the string (`Do`/`Ignore`). Based on the following rules, it judges whether to filter. If either of the two rules is satisfied, the binlog is filtered; otherwise, the binlog is not filtered.

    - `Do`: the allow list. The binlog is filtered in either of the following two conditions:
        - The type of the event is not in the `event` list of the rule.
        - The SQL statement of the event cannot be matched by `sql-pattern` of the rule.
    - `Ignore`: the block list. The binlog is filtered in either of the following two conditions:
        - The type of the event is in the `event` list of the rule.
        - The SQL statement of the event can be matched by `sql-pattern` of the rule.
    - When multiple rules match the same table, the rules are applied sequentially. The block list has a higher priority than the allow list. For example, if both the `Ignore` and `Do` rules are applied to the same table, the `Ignore` rule takes effect.

## Usage examples

This section shows the usage examples in the scenario of sharding (sharded schemas and tables).

### Filter all sharding deletion operations

To filter out all deletion operations, configure the following two filtering rules:

- `filter-table-rule` filters out the `TRUNCATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE` and `DELETE STATEMENT` operations of all tables that match the `test_*`.`t_*` pattern.
- `filter-schema-rule` filters out the `DROP DATABASE` operation of all schemas that match the `test_*` pattern.

```yaml
filters:
  filter-table-rule:
    schema-pattern: "test_*"
    table-pattern: "t_*"
    events: ["truncate table", "drop table", "delete"]
    action: Ignore
  filter-schema-rule:
    schema-pattern: "test_*"
    events: ["drop database"]
    action: Ignore
```

### Only migrate sharding DML statements

To only migrate sharding DML statements, configure the following two filtering rules:

- `do-table-rule` only migrates the `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements of all tables that match the `test_*`.`t_*` pattern.
- `do-schema-rule` only migrates the `CREATE DATABASE` statement of all schemas that match the `test_*` pattern.

> **Note:**
>
> The reason why the `CREATE DATABASE/TABLE` statement is migrated is that you can migrate DML statements only after the schema and table are created.

```yaml
filters:
  do-table-rule:
    schema-pattern: "test_*"
    table-pattern: "t_*"
    events: ["create table", "all dml"]
    action: Do
  do-schema-rule:
    schema-pattern: "test_*"
    events: ["create database"]
    action: Do
```

### Filter out the SQL statements that TiDB does not support

To filter out the `PROCEDURE` statements that TiDB does not support, configure the following `filter-procedure-rule`:

```yaml
filters:
  filter-procedure-rule:
    schema-pattern: "test_*"
    table-pattern: "t_*"
    sql-pattern: ["^DROP\\s+PROCEDURE", "^CREATE\\s+PROCEDURE"]
    action: Ignore
```

`filter-procedure-rule` filters out the `^CREATE\\s+PROCEDURE` and `^DROP\\s+PROCEDURE` statements of all tables that match the `test_*`.`t_*` pattern.

### Filter out the SQL statements that the TiDB parser does not support

For the SQL statements that the TiDB parser does not support, DM cannot parse them and get the `schema`/`table` information. So you must use the global filtering rule: `schema-pattern: "*"`.

> **Note:**
>
> To avoid filtering out data that need to be migrated, you must configure the global filtering rule as strictly as possible.

To filter out the `PARTITION` statements that the TiDB parser (of some version) does not support, configure the following filtering rule:

```yaml
filters:
  filter-partition-rule:
    schema-pattern: "*"
    sql-pattern: ["ALTER\\s+TABLE[\\s\\S]*ADD\\s+PARTITION", "ALTER\\s+TABLE[\\s\\S]*DROP\\s+PARTITION"]
    action: Ignore
```
