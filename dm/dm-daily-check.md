# Daily Check

This document summarizes how to perform a daily check on TiDB Data Migration (DM).

+ Method 1: Execute the `query-status` command to check the running status of the task and the error output (if any). For details, see [Query Status](/dm/dm-query-status.md).

+ Method 2: If Prometheus and Grafana are correctly deployed when you deploy the DM cluster using TiUP, you can view DM monitoring metrics in Grafana. For example, suppose that the Grafana's address is `172.16.10.71`, go to <http://172.16.10.71:3000>, enter the Grafana dashboard, and select the DM Dashboard to check monitoring metrics of DM. For more information of these metrics, see [DM Monitoring Metrics](/dm/monitor-a-dm-cluster.md).

+ Method 3: Check the running status of DM and the error (if any) using the log file.

    - DM-master log directory: It is specified by the `--log-file` DM-master process parameter. If DM is deployed using TiUP, the log directory is `{log_dir}` in the DM-master node.
    - DM-worker log directory: It is specified by the `--log-file` DM-worker process parameter. If DM is deployed using TiUP, the log directory is `{log_dir}` in the DM-worker node.
