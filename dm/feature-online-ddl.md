# Migrate from Databases that Use GH-ost/PT-osc

This document introduces the `online-ddl` feature of DM when DM is used to migrate data from MySQL to TiDB and how online DDL tools perform during the data migration process.

## Overview

DDL statements are always used in the database applications. MySQL 5.6 and later versions support `online-ddl` feature, but there are limitations for usage. For example, to acquire the MDL lock, some DDLs still need to be copied. In production scenarios, the table lock during DDL execution can block the reads or writes to and from the database to a certain extent.

Therefore, online DDL tools are often used to execute DDLs to reduce the impact on reads and writes. Common DDL tools are [gh-ost](https://github.com/github/gh-ost) and [pt-osc](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/3.0/pt-online-schema-change.html).

Generally, these tools work by the following steps:

1. Create a new ghost table according to the table schema of the DDL real table;
2. Apply DDLs on the ghost table;
3. Replicate the data of the DDL real table to the ghost table;
4. After the data are consistent between the two tables, use the `rename` statement to replace the real table with the ghost table.

When you migrate data from MySQL to TiDB using DM, online DDL tools can identify the DDLs in the above step 2 and apply them downstream in step 4, which can reduce the replication workload for the ghost table.

## `online-ddl` Configuration

Generally, it is recommended to enbale the `online-ddl` configuration and you can see the following effects:

![DM online-ddl](/media/dm/dm-online-ddl.png)

- The downstream TiDB does not need to create and replicate the ghost table, saving the storage space and network transmission overhead;
- When you merge and migrate data from sharded tables, the RENAME operation is ignored for each sharded ghost tables to ensure the correctness of the replication;
- Currently, one limitation for DM is that DMLs in this task are blocked until DDL operation is finished when you apply DDL operation to the downstream TiDB. This limitation will be removed later.

> **Note:**
>
> If you need to disable the `online-ddl` configuration, pay attention to the following effects:
> 
> - The downstream TiDB replicates the behaviors of online DDL tools like gh-ost/pt-osc;
> - You need to manually add various temporary tables and ghost tables generated by the online DDL tools to the task configuration white list;
> - You cannot merge and migrate data from sharded tables.

## Configuration

In the task configuration file, `online-ddl` is at the same level of `name`. For example:

```yml
# ----------- Global configuration -----------
## ********* Basic configuration *********
name: test                      # The name of the task. Should be globally unique.
task-mode: all                  # The task mode. Can be set to `full`/`incremental`/`all`.
shard-mode: "pessimistic"       # The shard merge mode. Optional modes are ""/"pessimistic"/"optimistic". The "" mode is used by default which means sharding DDL merge is disabled. If the task is a shard merge task, set it to the "pessimistic" mode. After understanding the principles and restrictions of the "optimistic" mode, you can set it to the "optimistic" mode.
meta-schema: "dm_meta"          # The downstream database that stores the `meta` information.
online-ddl: true                # Supports automatic processing of "gh-ost" and "pt" for the upstream database.
online-ddl-scheme: "gh-ost"     # `online-ddl-scheme` will be deprecated in the future, so it is recommended to use `online-ddl`.
target-database:                # Configuration of the downstream database instance.
  host: "192.168.0.1"
  port: 4000
  user: "root"
  password: ""                  # It is recommended to use password encrypted with dmctl if the password is not empty.
```

For the advanced configuration and the description of each configuration parameter, refer to [DM advanced task configuration file template](/dm/task-configuration-file-full.md#task-configuration-file-template-advanced).

When you merge and migrate data from sharded tables, you need to coordinate the DDL of each sharded table, and the DML before and after the DDL. DM supports two different modes: pessimistic mode and optimistic mode. For the differences and scenarios between the two modes, refer to [Merge and Migrate Data from Sharded Tables](/dm/feature-shard-merge.md).

## Working details for DM with online DDL tools

This section describes the working details for DM with the online DDL tools [gh-ost](https://github.com/github/gh-ost) and [pt-osc](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/3.0/pt-online-schema-change.html) when implementing online-schema-change.

### online-schema-change: gh-ost

When gh-ost implements online-schema-change, 3 types of tables are created:

- gho: used to apply DDLs. When the data is fully replicated and the gho table is consistent with the origin table, the origin table is replaced by renaming.
- ghc: used to store information that is related to online-schema-change.
- del: created by renaming the origin table.

In the process of migration, DM divides the above tables into 3 categories:

- ghostTable: `\_\*\_gho`
- trashTable: `\_\*\_ghc`, `\_\*\_del`
- realTable: the origin table that executes online-ddl.

The SQL statements mostly used by gh-ost and the corresponding operation of DM are as follows:

1. Create the `_ghc` table:

    ```sql
    Create /* gh-ost */ table `test`.`_test4_ghc` (
                            id bigint auto_increment,
                            last_update timestamp not null DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
                            hint varchar(64) charset ascii not null,
                            value varchar(4096) charset ascii not null,
                            primary key(id),
                            unique key hint_uidx(hint)
                    ) auto_increment=256 ;
    ```

    DM does not create the `_test4_ghc` table.

2. Create the `_gho` table:

    ```sql
    Create /* gh-ost */ table `test`.`_test4_gho` like `test`.`test4` ;
    ```

    DM does not create the `_test4_gho` table. DM deletes the `dm_meta.{task_name}\_onlineddl` record in the downstream according to `ghost_schema`, `ghost_table`, and the `server_id` of `dm_worker`, and clears the related information in memory.

    ```
    DELETE FROM dm_meta.{task_name}_onlineddl WHERE id = {server_id} and ghost_schema = {ghost_schema} and ghost_table = {ghost_table};
    ```

3. Apply the DDL that needs to be executed in the `_gho` table:

    ```sql
    Alter /* gh-ost */ table `test`.`_test4_gho` add column cl1 varchar(20) not null ;
    ```

    DM does not perform the DDL operation of `_test4_gho`. It records this DDL in `dm_meta.{task_name}\_onlineddl` and memory.

    ```sql
    REPLACE INTO dm_meta.{task_name}_onlineddl (id, ghost_schema , ghost_table , ddls) VALUES (......);
    ```

4. Write data to the `_ghc` table, and replicate the origin table data to the `_gho` table:

    ```sql
    Insert /* gh-ost */ into `test`.`_test4_ghc` values (......);
    Insert /* gh-ost `test`.`test4` */ ignore into `test`.`_test4_gho` (`id`, `date`, `account_id`, `conversion_price`, `ocpc_matched_conversions`, `ad_cost`, `cl2`)
      (select `id`, `date`, `account_id`, `conversion_price`, `ocpc_matched_conversions`, `ad_cost`, `cl2` from `test`.`test4` force index (`PRIMARY`)
        where (((`id` > _binary'1') or ((`id` = _binary'1'))) and ((`id` < _binary'2') or ((`id` = _binary'2')))) lock in share mode
      )   ;
    ```

    DM does not execute DML statements that are not for **realtable**.

5. After the migration is completed, both the origin table and `_gho` table are renamed, and the online DDL operation is completed:

    ```sql
    Rename /* gh-ost */ table `test`.`test4` to `test`.`_test4_del`, `test`.`_test4_gho` to `test`.`test4`;
    ```

    DM performs the following two operations:

    * DM splits the above `rename` operation into two SQL statements.

        ```sql
        rename test.test4 to test._test4_del;
        rename test._test4_gho to test.test4;
        ```

    * DM does not execute `rename to _test4_del`. When executing `rename ghost_table to origin table`, DM takes the following steps:

        - Read the DDL recorded in memory in Step 3
        - Replace `ghost_table` and `ghost_schema` with `origin_table` and its corresponding schema
        - Execute the DDL that has been replaced

        ```sql
        alter table test._test4_gho add column cl1 varchar(20) not null;
        -- Replaced with:
        alter table test.test4 add column cl1 varchar(20) not null;
        ```

> **Note:**

> The specific SQL statements of gh-ost vary with the parameters used in the execution. This document only lists the major SQL statements. For more details, refer to the [gh-ost documentation](https://github.com/github/gh-ost#gh-ost).

## online-schema-change: pt

When pt-osc implements online-schema-change, 2 types of tables are created:

- `new`: used to apply DDL. When the data is fully replicated and the `new` table is consistent with the origin table, the origin table is replaced by renaming.
- `old`: created by renaming the origin table.
- 3 kinds of Trigger: `pt_osc\_\*\_ins`, `pt_osc\_\*\_upd`, `pt_osc\_\*\_del`. In the process of pt_osc, the new data generated by the origin table is replicated to `new` by the Trigger.

In the process of migration, DM divides the above tables into 3 categories:

- ghostTable: `\_\*\_new`
- trashTable: `\_\*\_old`
- realTable: the origin table that executes online-ddl.

The SQL statements mostly used by pt-osc and the corresponding operation of DM are as follows:

1. Create the `_new` table:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE `test`.`_test4_new` ( id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    date date DEFAULT NULL, account_id bigint(20) DEFAULT NULL, conversion_price decimal(20,3) DEFAULT NULL,  ocpc_matched_conversions bigint(20) DEFAULT NULL, ad_cost decimal(20,3) DEFAULT NULL,cl2 varchar(20) COLLATE utf8mb4_bin NOT NULL,cl1 varchar(20) COLLATE utf8mb4_bin NOT NULL,PRIMARY KEY (id) ) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=3 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_bin ;
    ```

    DM does not create the `_test4_new` table. DM deletes the `dm_meta.{task_name}\_onlineddl` record in the downstream according to `ghost_schema`, `ghost_table`, and the `server_id` of `dm_worker`, and clears the related information in memory.

    ```sql
    DELETE FROM dm_meta.{task_name}_onlineddl WHERE id = {server_id} and ghost_schema = {ghost_schema} and ghost_table = {ghost_table};
    ```

2. Execute DDL in the `_new` table:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE `test`.`_test4_new` add column c3 int;
    ```

    DM does not perform the DDL operation of `_test4_new`. Instead, it records this DDL in `dm_meta.{task_name}\_onlineddl` and memory.

    ```sql
    REPLACE INTO dm_meta.{task_name}_onlineddl (id, ghost_schema , ghost_table , ddls) VALUES (......);
    ```

3. Create 3 Triggers used for data migration:

    ```sql
    CREATE TRIGGER `pt_osc_test_test4_del` AFTER DELETE ON `test`.`test4` ...... ;
    CREATE TRIGGER `pt_osc_test_test4_upd` AFTER UPDATE ON `test`.`test4` ...... ;
    CREATE TRIGGER `pt_osc_test_test4_ins` AFTER INSERT ON `test`.`test4` ...... ;
    ```

    DM does not execute Trigger operations that are not supported in TiDB.

4. Replicate the origin table data to the `_new` table:

    ```sql
    INSERT LOW_PRIORITY IGNORE INTO `test`.`_test4_new` (`id`, `date`, `account_id`, `conversion_price`, `ocpc_matched_conversions`, `ad_cost`, `cl2`, `cl1`) SELECT `id`, `date`, `account_id`, `conversion_price`, `ocpc_matched_conversions`, `ad_cost`, `cl2`, `cl1` FROM `test`.`test4` LOCK IN SHARE MODE /*pt-online-schema-change 3227 copy table*/
    ```

    DM does not execute the DML statements that are not for **realtable**.

5. After the data migration is completed, the origin table and `_new` table are renamed, and the online DDL operation is completed:

    ```sql
    RENAME TABLE `test`.`test4` TO `test`.`_test4_old`, `test`.`_test4_new` TO `test`.`test4`
    ```

    DM performs the following two operations:

    * DM splits the above `rename` operation into two SQL statements:

        ```sql
         rename test.test4 to test._test4_old;
         rename test._test4_new to test.test4;
         ```

    * DM does not execute `rename to _test4_old`. When executing `rename ghost_table to origin table`, DM takes the following steps:

        - Read the DDL recorded in memory in Step 2
        - Replace `ghost_table` and `ghost_schema` with `origin_table` and its corresponding schema
        - Execute the DDL that has been replaced

        ```sql
        ALTER TABLE `test`.`_test4_new` add column c3 int;
        -- Replaced with:
        ALTER TABLE `test`.`test4` add column c3 int;
        ```

6. Delete the `_old` table and 3 Triggers of the online DDL operation:

    ```sql
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `test`.`_test4_old`;
    DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS `pt_osc_test_test4_del` AFTER DELETE ON `test`.`test4` ...... ;
    DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS `pt_osc_test_test4_upd` AFTER UPDATE ON `test`.`test4` ...... ;
    DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS `pt_osc_test_test4_ins` AFTER INSERT ON `test`.`test4` ...... ;
    ```

    DM does not delete `_test4_old` and Triggers.
