# Build for deployment 

## Overview

> **Note:**
>
> The easiest way to deploy TiDB is to use the official binary package directly, see [Binary Deployment](../op-guide/binary-deployment.md).**

If you want to build the TiDB project, deploy the binaries to other machines and run them, you can follow this guide.

Check the [supported platforms](./requirements.md#supported-platforms) and [prerequisites](./requirements.md#prerequisites) first.

## Building and installing TiDB components

You can use the [build script](../scripts/build.sh) to build and install TiDB components in the `bin` directory.

You can use the [update script](../scripts/update.sh) to update all the TiDB components to the latest version.
