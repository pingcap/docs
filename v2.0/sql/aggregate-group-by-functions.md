# Aggregate (GROUP BY) Functions

This document describes details about the supported aggregate functions in TiDB.

## Aggregate (GROUP BY) function descriptions

This section describes the supported MySQL group (aggregate) functions in TiDB.

- Unless otherwise stated, group functions ignore `NULL` values.
- If you use a group function in a statement containing no `GROUP BY` clause, it is equivalent to grouping on all rows. For more information see [TiDB handling of GROUP BY](#tidb-handling-of-group-by).

## GROUP BY modifiers

TiDB dose not support any `GROUP BY` modifiers currently. We'll do it in the future. For more information, see [#4250](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/4250).

TiDB performs equivalent to MySQL with sql mode [`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_only_full_group_by) being disabled: permits the `SELECT` list, `HAVING` condition, or `ORDER BY` list to refer to non-aggregated columns even if the columns are not functionally dependent on `GROUP BY` columns.

For example, this query is illegal in MySQL 5.7.5 with `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` enabled because the non-aggregated column "b" in the `SELECT` list does not appear in the `GROUP BY`:

```sql
drop table if exists t;
create table t(a bigint, b bigint, c bigint);
insert into t values(1, 2, 3), (2, 2, 3), (3, 2, 3);
select a, b, sum(c) from t group by a;
```

The preceding query is legal in TiDB. TiDB does not support SQL mode `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` currently. We'll do it in the future. For more inmormation, see [#4248](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/4248).

Suppose that we execute the following query, expecting the results to be ordered by "c":
```sql
drop table if exists t;
create table t(a bigint, b bigint, c bigint);
insert into t values(1, 2, 1), (1, 2, 2), (1, 3, 1), (1, 3, 2);
select distinct a, b from t order by c;
```

To order the result, duplicates must be eliminated first. But to do so, which row should we keep? This choice influences the retained value of "c", which in turn influences ordering and makes it arbitrary as well.

In MySQL, a query that has `DISTINCT` and `ORDER BY` is rejected as invalid if any `ORDER BY` expression does not satisfy at least one of these conditions:
- The expression is equal to one in the `SELECT` list
- All columns referenced by the expression and belonging to the query's selected tables are elements of the `SELECT` list

But in TiDB, the above query is legal, for more information see [#4254](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/4254).

Another TiDB extension to standard SQL permits references in the `HAVING` clause to aliased expressions in the `SELECT` list. For example, the following query returns "name" values that occur only once in table "orders":
```sql
select name, count(name) from orders
group by name
having count(name) = 1;
```

The TiDB extension permits the use of an alias in the `HAVING` clause for the aggregated column:
```sql
select name, count(name) as c from orders
group by name
having c = 1;
```

Standard SQL permits only column expressions in `GROUP BY` clauses, so a statement such as this is invalid because "FLOOR(value/100)" is a noncolumn expression:
```sql
select id, floor(value/100)
from tbl_name
group by id, floor(value/100);
```

TiDB extends standard SQL to permit noncolumn expressions in `GROUP BY` clauses and considers the preceding statement valid.

Standard SQL also does not permit aliases in `GROUP BY` clauses. TiDB extends standard SQL to permit aliases, so another way to write the query is as follows:
```sql
select id, floor(value/100) as val
from tbl_name
group by id, val;
```

## Detection of functional dependence

TiDB does not support SQL mode `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` and detection of functional dependence. We'll do it in the future. For more information, see [#4248](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/4248).
