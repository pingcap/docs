# TiDB Quick Start Guide

## About TiDB

TiDB (The pronunciation is: /'taɪdiːbi:/ tai-D-B, etymology: titanium) is an open-source distributed scalable Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) database. It features infinite horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and high availability. TiDB is MySQL compatible and serves as a one-stop data warehouse for both OLTP (Online Transactional Processing) and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) workloads.

## About this guide

This guide outlines how to perform a quick deployment of a TiDB cluster using TiDB-Ansible and walks you through the basic TiDB operations and administrations.

## Deploy the TiDB cluster

This section describes how to deploy a TiDB cluster. A TiDB cluster consists of different components: TiDB servers, TiKV servers, and Placement Driver (PD) servers.

The architecture is as follows:

To quickly deploy a TiDB testing cluster, see [Deploy TiDB Using Docker Compose](op-guide/docker-compose.md).

## Try TiDB

This section describes some basic CRUD operations in TiDB.

### Create, show, and drop a database

- To create a database, use the `CREATE DATABASE` statement. The Syntax is as follows:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE db_name [options];
    ```

    For example, the following statement creates a database with the name `samp_db`:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS samp_db;
    ```

- To show the databases, use the `SHOW DATABASES` statement:

    ```sql
    SHOW DATABASES;
    ```

- To delete a database, use the `DROP DATABASE` statement. For example:

    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE samp_db;
    ```

### Create, show, and drop a table

- To create a table, use the `CREATE TABLE` statement. The Syntax is as follows:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE table_name column_name data_type constraint;
    ```

    For example:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE person (
     number INT(11),
     name VARCHAR(255),
     birthday DATE
    );
    ```

    Add `IF NOT EXISTS` to prevent an error if the table exists:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS person (
     number INT(11),
     name VARCHAR(255),
     birthday DATE
    );
    ```

- To view the statement that creates the table, use the `SHOW CREATE` statement. For example:

    ```sql
    SHOW CREATE table person;
    ```

- To show all the tables in a database, use the `SHOW TABLES` statement. For example:

    ```sql
    SHOW TABLES FROM samp_db;
    ```

- To show the information about all the columns in a table, use the `SHOW FULL COLUMNS` statement. For example:

    ```sql
    SHOW FULL COLUMNS FROM person;
    ```

- To delete a table, use the `DROP TABLE` statement. For example:

    ```sql
    DROP TABLE person;
    ```

    or

    ```sql
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS person;
    ```

### Create, show, and drop an index

- To create an index for the column whose value is not unique, use the `CREATE INDEX` or `ALTER TABLE` statement. For example:

    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX person_num ON person (number);
    ```

    or

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE person ADD INDEX person_num (number);
    ```

- To create a unique index for the column whose value is unique, use the `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` or `ALTER TABLE` statement. For example:

    ```sql
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX person_num ON person (number);
    ```

    or

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE person ADD UNIQUE person_num on (number);
    ```

- To show all the indexes in a table, use the `SHOW INDEX` statement:

    ```sql
    SHOW INDEX from person;
    ```

- To delete an index, use the `DROP INDEX` or `ALTER TABLE` statement. For example:

    ```sql
    DROP INDEX person_num ON person;
    ALTER TABLE person DROP INDEX person_num;
    ```

### Insert, select, update, and delete data

- To insert data into a table, use the `INSERT` statement. For example:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO person VALUES("1","tom","20170912");
    ```

- To view the data in a table, use the `SELECT` statement. For example:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM person;
    +--------+------+------------+
    | number | name | birthday   |
    +--------+------+------------+
    |      1 | tom  | 2017-09-12 |
    +--------+------+------------+
    ```

- To update the data in a table, use the `UPDATE` statement. For example:

    ```sql
    UPDATE person SET birthday='20171010' WHERE name='tom';

    SELECT * FROM person;
    +--------+------+------------+
    | number | name | birthday   |
    +--------+------+------------+
    |      1 | tom  | 2017-10-10 |
    +--------+------+------------+
    ```

- To delete the data in a table, use the `DELETE` statement. For example:

    ```sql
    DELETE FROM person WHERE number=1;
    SELECT * FROM person;
    Empty set (0.00 sec)
    ```

### Create, authorize, and delete a user

- To create a user, use the `CREATE USER` statement. The following example creates a user named `tiuser` with the password `123456`:

    ```sql
    CREATE USER 'tiuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '123456';
    ```

- To grant `tiuser` the privilege to retrieve the tables in the `samp_db` database:

    ```sql
    GRANT SELECT ON samp_db.* TO 'tiuser'@'localhost';
    ```

- To check the privileges of `tiuser`:

    ```sql
    SHOW GRANTS for tiuser@localhost;
    ```

- To delete `tiuser`:

    ```sql
    DROP USER 'tiuser'@'localhost';
    ```

## Monitor the TiDB cluster

Open a browser to access the monitoring platform: `http://172.16.10.3:3000`.

The default account and password are: `admin`/`admin`.

### About the key metrics

Service | Panel Name | Description | Normal Range
---- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------
PD | Storage Capacity | the total storage capacity of the TiDB cluster |
PD | Current Storage Size | the occupied storage capacity of the TiDB cluster |
PD | Store Status  -- up store | the number of TiKV nodes that are up |
PD | Store Status  -- down store | the number of TiKV nodes that are down | `0`. If the number is bigger than `0`, it means some node(s) are not down.
PD | Store Status  -- offline store | the number of TiKV nodes that are manually offline|
PD | Store Status  -- Tombstone store | the number of TiKV nodes that are Tombstone|
PD | Current storage usage | the storage occupancy rate of the TiKV cluster | If it exceeds 80%, you need to consider adding more TiKV nodes.
PD | 99% completed cmds duration seconds | the 99th percentile duration to complete a pd-server request| less than 5ms
PD | average completed cmds duration seconds | the average duration to complete a pd-server request | less than 50ms
PD | leader balance ratio | the leader ratio difference of the nodes with the biggest leader ratio and the smallest leader ratio | It is less than 5% for a balanced situation. It becomes bigger when a node is restarting.
PD | region balance ratio | the region ratio difference of the nodes with the biggest region ratio and the smallest region ratio | It is less than 5% for a balanced situation. It becomes bigger when adding or removing a node.
TiDB | handle requests duration seconds | the response time to get TSO from PD| less than 100ms
TiDB | tidb server QPS | the QPS of the cluster | application specific
TiDB | connection count | the number of connections from application servers to the database | Application specific. If the number of connections hops, you need to find out the reasons. If it drops to 0, you can check if the network is broken; if it surges, you need to check the application.
TiDB | statement count | the number of different types of statement within a given time | application specific
TiDB | Query Duration 99th percentile | the 99th percentile query time |
TiKV | 99%  & 99.99% scheduler command duration | the 99th percentile and 99.99th percentile scheduler command duration| For 99%, it is less than 50ms; for 99.99%, it is less than 100ms.
TiKV | 95%  & 99.99% storage async_request duration | the 95th percentile and 99.99th percentile Raft command duration | For 95%, it is less than 50ms; for 99.99%, it is less than 100ms.
TiKV | server report failure message | There might be an issue with the network or the message might not come from this cluster. | If there are large amount of messages which contains `unreachable`, there might be an issue with the network. If the message contains `store not match`, the message does not come from this cluster.
TiKV  | Vote |the frequency of the Raft vote | Usually, the value only changes when there is a split. If the value of Vote remains high for a long time, the system might have a severe issue and some nodes are not working.
TiKV | 95% and 99% coprocessor request duration | the 95th percentile and the 99th percentile coprocessor request duration | Application specific. Usually, the value does not remain high.
TiKV | Pending task | the number of pending tasks | Except for PD worker, it is not normal if the value is too high.
TiKV | stall | RocksDB stall time | If the value is bigger than 0, it means that RocksDB is too busy, and you need to pay attention to IO and CPU usage.
TiKV | channel full | The channel is full and the threads are too busy. | If the value is bigger than 0, the threads are too busy.
TiKV |  95% send message duration seconds | the 95th percentile message sending time | less than 50ms
TiKV | leader/region | the number of leader/region per TiKV server| application specific
