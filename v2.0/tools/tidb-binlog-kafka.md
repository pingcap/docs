# TiDB-Binlog User Guide

This document describes how to deploy the Kafka version of TiDB-Binlog. If you need to deploy the local version of TiDB-Binlog, see the [TiDB-Binlog user guide for the local version](tidb-binlog.md).

## About TiDB-Binlog

TiDB-Binlog is a tool for enterprise users to collect binlog files for TiDB and provide real-time backup and synchronization.

TiDB-Binlog supports the following scenarios:

- **Data synchronization**: to synchronize TiDB cluster data to other databases  
- **Real-time backup and recovery**: to back up TiDB cluster data, and recover in case of cluster outages

## TiDB-Binlog architecture

The TiDB-Binlog architecture is as follows:

![TiDB-Binlog architecture](../media/tidb_binlog_kafka_architecture.png)

The TiDB-Binlog cluster mainly consists of three components:

### Pump

Pump is a daemon that runs on the background of each TiDB host. Its main function is to record the binlog files generated by TiDB in real time and write to the file in the disk sequentially.

### Drainer

Drainer collects binlog files from each Pump node, converts them into specified database-compatible SQL statements in the commit order of the transactions in TiDB, and synchronizes to the target database or writes to the file sequentially.

### Kafka & ZooKeeper

The Kafka cluster stores the binlog data written by Pump and provides the binlog data to Drainer for reading.

> **Note:** In the local version of TiDB-Binlog, the binlog is stored in files, while in the latest version, the binlog is stored using Kafka.

## Install TiDB-Binlog

### Download Binary for the CentOS 7.3+ platform

```bash
# Download the tool package.
wget http://download.pingcap.org/tidb-binlog-latest-linux-amd64.tar.gz
wget http://download.pingcap.org/tidb-binlog-latest-linux-amd64.sha256

# Check the file integrity. If the result is OK, the file is correct.
sha256sum -c tidb-binlog-latest-linux-amd64.sha256

# Extract the package.
tar -xzf tidb-binlog-latest-linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd tidb-binlog-latest-linux-amd64
```

## Deploy TiDB-Binlog

### Note

- You need to deploy a Pump for each TiDB server in the TiDB cluster. Currently, the TiDB server only supports the binlog in UNIX socket.

- When you deploy a Pump manually, to start the service, follow the order of Pump -> TiDB; to stop the service, follow the order of TiDB -> Pump.

    We set the startup parameter `binlog-socket` as the specified unix socket file path of the corresponding parameter `socket` in Pump. The final deployment architecture is as follows:

    ![TiDB Pump deployment architecture](../media/tidb_pump_deployment.jpeg)

- Drainer does not support renaming DDL on the table of the ignored schemas (schemas in the filter list).

- To start Drainer in the existing TiDB cluster, usually you need to do a full backup, get the savepoint, import the full backup, and start Drainer and synchronize from the savepoint.

    To guarantee the integrity of data, perform the following operations 10 minutes after Pump is started:

    - Use [binlogctl](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-tools/tree/master/tidb_binlog/binlogctl) of the [tidb-tools](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-tools) project to generate the `position` for the initial start of Drainer.
    - Do a full backup. For example, back up TiDB using Mydumper.
    - Import the full backup to the target system.
    - The savepoint metadata started by the Kafka version of Drainer is stored in the `checkpoint` table of the downstream database `tidb_binlog` by default. If no valid data exists in the `checkpoint` table, configure `initial-commit-ts` to make Drainer work from a specified position when it is started:

        ```
        bin/drainer --config=conf/drainer.toml --initial-commit-ts=${position}
        ```

- The drainer outputs `pb` and you need to set the following parameters in the configuration file:

    ```
    [syncer]
    db-type = "pb"
    disable-dispatch = true

    [syncer.to]
    dir = "/path/pb-dir"
    ```

- The drainer outputs `kafka` and you need to set the following parameters in the configuration file:

    ```
    [syncer]
    db-type = "kafka"
    
    # when db-type is kafka, you can uncomment this to config the down stream kafka, or it will be the same kafka addrs where drainer pulls binlog from.
    # [syncer.to]
    # kafka-addrs = "127.0.0.1:9092"
    # kafka-version = "0.8.2.0"
    ```
    
    The data which outputs to kafka follows the binlog format sorted by ts and defined by protobuf. See [driver](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-tools/tree/master/tidb_binlog/driver) to access the data and sync to the down stream.
    
- Deploy Kafka and ZooKeeper cluster before deploying TiDB-Binlog. Make sure that Kafka is 0.9 version or later.

#### Recommended Kafka cluster configuration

| Name | Number | Memory size | CPU | Hard disk |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Kafka | 3+ | 16G | 8+ | 2+ 1TB |
| ZooKeeper | 3+ | 8G | 4+ | 2+ 300G |

#### Recommended Kafka parameter configuration

- `auto.create.topics.enable = true`: if no topic exists, Kafka automatically creates a topic on the broker.
- `broker.id`: a required parameter to identify the Kafka cluster. Keep the parameter value unique. For example, `broker.id = 1`.
- `fs.file-max = 1000000`: Kafka uses a lot of files and network sockets. It is recommended to change the parameter value to 1000000. Change the value using `vi /etc/sysctl.conf`.

### Deploy Pump using TiDB-Ansible

- If you have not deployed the Kafka cluster, use the [Kafka-Ansible](https://github.com/pingcap/thirdparty-ops/tree/master/kafka-ansible) to deploy.
- When you deploy the TiDB cluster using [TiDB-Ansible](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-ansible), edit the `tidb-ansible/inventory.ini` file, set `enable_binlog = True`, and configure the `zookeeper_addrs` variable as the ZooKeeper address of the Kafka cluster. In this way, Pump is deployed while you deploy the TiDB cluster.

Configuration example:

```
# binlog trigger
enable_binlog = True
# ZooKeeper address of the Kafka cluster. Example:
# zookeeper_addrs = "192.168.0.11:2181,192.168.0.12:2181,192.168.0.13:2181"
# You can also append an optional chroot string to the URLs to specify the root directory for all Kafka znodes. Example:
# zookeeper_addrs = "192.168.0.11:2181,192.168.0.12:2181,192.168.0.13:2181/kafka/123"
zookeeper_addrs = "192.168.0.11:2181,192.168.0.12:2181,192.168.0.13:2181"
```

### Deploy Pump using Binary

A usage example:

Assume that we have three PDs, three ZooKeepers, and one TiDB. The information of each node is as follows:

```
TiDB="192.168.0.10"
PD1="192.168.0.16"
PD2="192.168.0.15"
PD3="192.168.0.14"
ZK1="192.168.0.13"
ZK2="192.168.0.12"
ZK3="192.168.0.11"
```

Deploy Drainer/Pump on the machine with the IP address "192.168.0.10".

The IP address of the corresponding PD cluster is "192.168.0.16,192.168.0.15,192.168.0.14". 

The ZooKeeper IP address of the corresponding Kafka cluster is "192.168.0.13,192.168.0.12,192.168.0.11".

This example describes how to use Pump/Drainer.

PbReader parses the pb file generated by Drainer and translates it into SQL statements.

CentOS 7+

```bash
# Download PbReader package
wget http://download.pingcap.org/pb_reader-latest-linux-amd64.tar.gz
wget http://download.pingcap.org/pb_reader-latest-linux-amd64.sha256

# Check the file integrity. If the result is OK, the file is correct.
sha256sum -c pb_reader-latest-linux-amd64.sha256

# Extract the package.
tar -xzf pb_reader-latest-linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd pb_reader-latest-linux-amd64
```

The PbReader usage example

```bash
./bin/pbReader -binlog-file=${path}/binlog-0000000000000000
```

## Monitor TiDB-Binlog

This section introduces how to monitor TiDB-Binlog's status and performance, and display the metrics using Prometheus and Grafana.

### Configure Pump/Drainer

Use the Pump service deployed using Ansible. Set metrics in startup parameters.

When you start Drainer, set the two parameters of `--metrics-addr` and `--metrics-interval`. Set `--metrics-addr` as the address of Push Gateway. Set `--metrics-interval` as the frequency of push (default 15 seconds).

### Configure Grafana

#### Create a Prometheus data source

1. Login the Grafana Web interface. 

    - The default address is: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

    - The default account name: admin

    - The password for the default account: admin

2. Click the Grafana logo to open the sidebar menu.

3. Click "Data Sources" in the sidebar.

4. Click "Add data source".

5. Specify the data source information:

    - Specify the name for the data source.
    - For Type, select Prometheus.
    - For Url, specify the Prometheus address.
    - Specify other fields as needed.

6. Click "Add" to save the new data source.

#### Create a Grafana dashboard

1. Click the Grafana logo to open the sidebar menu.

2. On the sidebar menu, click "Dashboards" -> "Import" to open the "Import Dashboard" window.

3. Click "Upload .json File" to upload a JSON file (Download [TiDB Grafana Config](https://grafana.com/tidb)).
