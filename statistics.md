# Introduction to Statistics

TiDB uses statistics to decide [which index to choose](/choose-index.md).

## Versions of statistics

The `tidb_analyze_version` variable controls the statistics collected by TiDB. Currently, two versions of statistics are supported: `tidb_analyze_version = 1` and `tidb_analyze_version = 2`.

- For TiDB Self-Hosted, the default value of this variable changes from `1` to `2` starting from v5.3.0.
- For TiDB Cloud, the default value of this variable changes from `1` to `2` starting from v6.5.0.
- If your cluster is upgraded from an earlier version, the default value of `tidb_analyze_version` does not change after the upgrade.

Compared to Version 1, Version 2 statistics avoids the potential inaccuracy caused by hash collision when the data volume is huge. It also maintains the estimate precision in most scenarios.

These two versions include different information in TiDB:

| Information | Version 1 | Version 2|
| --- | --- | ---|
| The total number of rows in the table | √ | √ |
| Column Count-Min Sketch | √ | × |
| Index Count-Min Sketch | √ | × |
| Column Top-N | √ | √ (Maintenance methods and precision are improved) |
| Index Top-N | √ (Insufficient maintenance precision might cause inaccuracy) | √ (Maintenance methods and precision are improved) |
| Column histogram | √ | √ (The histogram does not include Top-N values.) |
| Index histogram | √ | √ (The histogram buckets record the number of different values in each bucket, and the histogram does not include Top-N values.) |
| The number of `NULL`s in the column | √ | √ |
| The number of `NULL`s in the index | √ | √ |
| The average length of columns | √ | √ |
| The average length of indexes | √ | √ |

When `tidb_analyze_version = 2`, if memory overflow occurs after `ANALYZE` is executed, you need to set `tidb_analyze_version = 1` to fall back to Version 1, and perform one of the following operations:

- If the `ANALYZE` statement is executed manually, manually analyze every table to be analyzed.

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT(CONCAT('ANALYZE TABLE ', table_schema, '.', table_name, ';')) FROM information_schema.tables, mysql.stats_histograms WHERE stats_ver = 2 AND table_id = tidb_table_id;
    ```

- If TiDB automatically executes the `ANALYZE` statement because the auto-analysis has been enabled, execute the following statement that generates the `DROP STATS` statement:

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT(CONCAT('DROP STATS ', table_schema, '.', table_name, ';')) FROM information_schema.tables, mysql.stats_histograms WHERE stats_ver = 2 AND table_id = tidb_table_id;
    ```

- If the result of the preceding statement is too long to copy and paste, you can export the result to a temporary text file and then perform execution from the file like this:

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT ... INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/sql.txt';
    mysql -h ${TiDB_IP} -u user -P ${TIDB_PORT} ... < '/tmp/sql.txt'
    ```

This document briefly introduces the histogram, Count-Min Sketch, and Top-N, and details the collection and maintenance of statistics.

## Histogram

A histogram is an approximate representation of the distribution of data. It divides the entire range of values into a series of buckets, and uses simple data to describe each bucket, such as the number of values ​​falling in the bucket. In TiDB, an equal-depth histogram is created for the specific columns of each table. The equal-depth histogram can be used to estimate the interval query.

Here "equal-depth" means that the number of values ​​falling into each bucket is as equal as possible. For example, for a given set {1.6, 1.9, 1.9, 2.0, 2.4, 2.6, 2.7, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.4, 3.5}, you want to generate 4 buckets. The equal-depth histogram is as follows. It contains four buckets [1.6, 1.9], [2.0, 2.6], [2.7, 2.8], [2.9, 3.5]. The bucket depth is 3.

![Equal-depth Histogram Example](/media/statistics-1.png)

For details about the parameter that determines the upper limit to the number of histogram buckets, refer to [Manual Collection](#manual-collection). When the number of buckets is larger, the accuracy of the histogram is higher; however, higher accuracy is at the cost of the usage of memory resources. You can adjust this number appropriately according to the actual scenario.

## Count-Min Sketch

Count-Min Sketch is a hash structure. When an equivalence query contains `a = 1` or `IN` query (for example, `a in (1, 2, 3)`), TiDB uses this data structure for estimation.

A hash collision might occur since Count-Min Sketch is a hash structure. In the `EXPLAIN` statement, if the estimate of the equivalent query deviates greatly from the actual value, it can be considered that a larger value and a smaller value have been hashed together. In this case, you can take one of the following ways to avoid the hash collision:

- Modify the `WITH NUM TOPN` parameter. TiDB stores the high-frequency (top x) data separately, with the other data stored in Count-Min Sketch. Therefore, to prevent a larger value and a smaller value from being hashed together, you can increase the value of `WITH NUM TOPN`. In TiDB, its default value is 20. The maximum value is 1024. For more information about this parameter, see [Manual collection](#manual-collection).
- Modify two parameters `WITH NUM CMSKETCH DEPTH` and `WITH NUM CMSKETCH WIDTH`. Both affect the number of hash buckets and the collision probability. You can increase the values of the two parameters appropriately according to the actual scenario to reduce the probability of hash collision, but at the cost of higher memory usage of statistics. In TiDB, the default value of `WITH NUM CMSKETCH DEPTH` is 5, and the default value of `WITH NUM CMSKETCH WIDTH` is 2048. For more information about the two parameters, see [Manual collection](#manual-collection).

## Top-N values

Top-N values are values with the top N occurrences in a column or index. TiDB records the values and occurrences of Top-N values.

## Collect statistics

### Manual collection

Currently, TiDB collects statistical information as a full collection. You can execute the `ANALYZE TABLE` statement to collect statistics.

> **Note:**
>
> - The execution time of `ANALYZE TABLE` in TiDB is longer than that in MySQL or InnoDB. In InnoDB, only a small number of pages are sampled, while in TiDB a comprehensive set of statistics is completely rebuilt. Scripts that were written for MySQL might mistakenly expect that `ANALYZE TABLE` will be a short-lived operation.
> - Starting from v7.5.0, the [Fast Analyze feature (`tidb_enable_fast_analyze`)](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_fast_analyze) and the [incremental collection feature](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.4/statistics#incremental-collection) for statistics are deprecated.

You can perform full collection using the following syntax.

+ To collect statistics of all the tables in `TableNameList`:

    {{< copyable "sql" >}}

    ```sql
    ANALYZE TABLE TableNameList [WITH NUM BUCKETS|TOPN|CMSKETCH DEPTH|CMSKETCH WIDTH]|[WITH NUM SAMPLES|WITH FLOATNUM SAMPLERATE];
    ```

+ `WITH NUM BUCKETS` specifies the maximum number of buckets in the generated histogram.
+ `WITH NUM TOPN` specifies the maximum number of the generated `TOPN`s.
+ `WITH NUM CMSKETCH DEPTH` specifies the depth of the CM Sketch.
+ `WITH NUM CMSKETCH WIDTH` specifies the width of the CM Sketch.
+ `WITH NUM SAMPLES` specifies the number of samples.
+ `WITH FLOAT_NUM SAMPLERATE` specifies the sampling rate.

`WITH NUM SAMPLES` and `WITH FLOAT_NUM SAMPLERATE` correspond to two different algorithms of collecting samples.

- `WITH NUM SAMPLES` specifies the size of the sampling set, which is implemented in the reservoir sampling method in TiDB. When a table is large, it is not recommended to use this method to collect statistics. Because the intermediate result set of the reservoir sampling contains redundant results, it causes additional pressure on resources such as memory.
- `WITH FLOAT_NUM SAMPLERATE` is a sampling method introduced in v5.3.0. With the value range `(0, 1]`, this parameter specifies the sampling rate. It is implemented in the way of Bernoulli sampling in TiDB, which is more suitable for sampling larger tables and performs better in collection efficiency and resource usage.

Before v5.3.0, TiDB uses the reservoir sampling method to collect statistics. Since v5.3.0, the TiDB Version 2 statistics uses the Bernoulli sampling method to collect statistics by default. To re-use the reservoir sampling method, you can use the `WITH NUM SAMPLES` statement.

The current sampling rate is calculated based on an adaptive algorithm. When you can observe the number of rows in a table using [`SHOW STATS_META`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-show-stats-meta.md), you can use this number of rows to calculate the sampling rate corresponding to 100,000 rows. If you cannot observe this number, you can use the `TABLE_KEYS` column in the [`TABLE_STORAGE_STATS`](/information-schema/information-schema-table-storage-stats.md) table as another reference to calculate the sampling rate.

<CustomContent platform="tidb">

> **Note:**
>
> Normally, `STATS_META` is more credible than `TABLE_KEYS`. However, after importing data through the methods like [TiDB Lightning](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/tidb-lightning-overview), the result of `STATS_META` is `0`. To handle this situation, you can use `TABLE_KEYS` to calculate the sampling rate when the result of `STATS_META` is much smaller than the result of `TABLE_KEYS`.

</CustomContent>

<CustomContent platform="tidb-cloud">

> **Note:**
>
> Normally, `STATS_META` is more credible than `TABLE_KEYS`. However, after importing data through TiDB Cloud console (see [Import Sample Data](/tidb-cloud/import-sample-data.md)), the result of `STATS_META` is `0`. To handle this situation, you can use `TABLE_KEYS` to calculate the sampling rate when the result of `STATS_META` is much smaller than the result of `TABLE_KEYS`.

#### Collect statistics on some columns

In most cases, when executing SQL statements, the optimizer only uses statistics on some columns (such as columns in the `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY` statements). These columns are called `PREDICATE COLUMNS`.

If a table has many columns, collecting statistics on all the columns can cause a large overhead. To reduce the overhead, you can collect statistics on only specific columns or `PREDICATE COLUMNS` to be used by the optimizer.

> **Note:**
>
> - Collecting statistics on some columns is only applicable for [`tidb_analyze_version = 2`](/system-variables.md#tidb_analyze_version-new-in-v510).
> - Starting from TiDB v7.2.0, TiDB introduces the [`tidb_analyze_skip_column_types`](/system-variables.md#tidb_analyze_skip_column_types-new-in-v720) system variable, indicating which types of columns are skipped for statistics collection when executing the `ANALYZE` command to collect statistics. The system variable is only applicable for `tidb_analyze_version = 2`.

- To collect statistics on specific columns, use the following syntax:

    {{< copyable "sql" >}}

    ```sql
    ANALYZE TABLE TableName COLUMNS ColumnNameList [WITH NUM BUCKETS|TOPN|CMSKETCH DEPTH|CMSKETCH WIDTH]|[WITH NUM SAMPLES|WITH FLOATNUM SAMPLERATE];
    ```

    In the syntax, `ColumnNameList` specifies the name list of the target columns. If you need to specify more than one column, use comma `,` to separate the column names. For example, `ANALYZE table t columns a, b`. Besides collecting statistics on the specific columns in a specific table, this syntax collects statistics on the indexed columns and all indexes in that table at the same time.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > The syntax above is a full collection. For example, after collecting statistics on columns `a` and `b` using this syntax, if you also want to collect statistics on column `c`, you need to specify all three columns using `ANALYZE table t columns a, b, c`, rather than only specifying the additional column `c` using `ANALYZE TABLE t COLUMNS c`.

- To collect statistics on `PREDICATE COLUMNS`, do the following:

    > **Warning:**
    >
    > Currently, collecting statistics on `PREDICATE COLUMNS` is an experimental feature. It is not recommended that you use it in production environments.

    1. Set the value of the [`tidb_enable_column_tracking`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_column_tracking-new-in-v540) system variable to `ON` to enable TiDB to collect `PREDICATE COLUMNS`.

        <CustomContent platform="tidb">

        After the setting, TiDB writes the `PREDICATE COLUMNS` information to the `mysql.column_stats_usage` system table every 100 * [`stats-lease`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#stats-lease).

        </CustomContent>

        <CustomContent platform="tidb-cloud">

        After the setting, TiDB writes the `PREDICATE COLUMNS` information to the `mysql.column_stats_usage` system table every 300 seconds.

        </CustomContent>

    2. After the query pattern of your business is relatively stable, collect statistics on `PREDICATE COLUMNS` by using the following syntax:

        {{< copyable "sql" >}}

        ```sql
        ANALYZE TABLE TableName PREDICATE COLUMNS [WITH NUM BUCKETS|TOPN|CMSKETCH DEPTH|CMSKETCH WIDTH]|[WITH NUM SAMPLES|WITH FLOATNUM SAMPLERATE];
        ```

        Besides collecting statistics on `PREDICATE COLUMNS` in a specific table, this syntax collects statistics on indexed columns and all indexes in that table at the same time.

        > **Note:**
        >
        > - If the `mysql.column_stats_usage` system table does not contain any `PREDICATE COLUMNS` record for that table, the preceding syntax collects statistics on all columns and all indexes in that table.
        > - After using this syntax to collect statistics, when executing a new type of SQL query, the optimizer might temporarily use the old or pseudo column statistics for this time, and TiDB will collect the statistics on the used columns from the next time.

- To collect statistics on all columns and indexes, use the following syntax:

    {{< copyable "sql" >}}

    ```sql
    ANALYZE TABLE TableName ALL COLUMNS [WITH NUM BUCKETS|TOPN|CMSKETCH DEPTH|CMSKETCH WIDTH]|[WITH NUM SAMPLES|WITH FLOATNUM SAMPLERATE];
    ```

If you want to persist the column configuration in the `ANALYZE` statement (including `COLUMNS ColumnNameList`, `PREDICATE COLUMNS`, and `ALL COLUMNS`), set the value of the `tidb_persist_analyze_options` system variable to `ON` to enable the [ANALYZE configuration persistence](#persist-analyze-configurations) feature. After enabling the ANALYZE configuration persistence feature:

- When TiDB collects statistics automatically or when you manually collect statistics by executing the `ANALYZE` statement without specifying the column configuration, TiDB continues using the previously persisted configuration for statistics collection.
- When you manually execute the `ANALYZE` statement multiple times with column configuration specified, TiDB overwrites the previously recorded persistent configuration using the new configuration specified by the latest `ANALYZE` statement.

To locate `PREDICATE COLUMNS` and columns on which statistics have been collected, use the following syntax:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SHOW COLUMN_STATS_USAGE [ShowLikeOrWhere];
```

The `SHOW COLUMN_STATS_USAGE` statement returns the following 6 columns:

| Column name | Description            |
| -------- | ------------- |
| `Db_name`  |  The database name    |
| `Table_name` | The table name |
| `Partition_name` | The partition name |
| `Column_name` | The column name |
| `Last_used_at` | The last time when the column statistics were used in the query optimization |
| `Last_analyzed_at` | The last time when the column statistics were collected |

In the following example, after executing `ANALYZE TABLE t PREDICATE COLUMNS;`, TiDB collects statistics on columns `b`, `c`, and `d`, where column `b` is a `PREDICATE COLUMN` and columns `c` and `d` are index columns.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SET GLOBAL tidb_enable_column_tracking = ON;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

CREATE TABLE t (a INT, b INT, c INT, d INT, INDEX idx_c_d(c, d));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

-- The optimizer uses the statistics on column b in this query.
SELECT * FROM t WHERE b > 1;
Empty set (0.00 sec)

-- After waiting for a period of time (100 * stats-lease), TiDB writes the collected `PREDICATE COLUMNS` to mysql.column_stats_usage.
-- Specify `last_used_at IS NOT NULL` to show the `PREDICATE COLUMNS` collected by TiDB.
SHOW COLUMN_STATS_USAGE WHERE db_name = 'test' AND table_name = 't' AND last_used_at IS NOT NULL;
+---------+------------+----------------+-------------+---------------------+------------------+
| Db_name | Table_name | Partition_name | Column_name | Last_used_at        | Last_analyzed_at |
+---------+------------+----------------+-------------+---------------------+------------------+
| test    | t          |                | b           | 2022-01-05 17:21:33 | NULL             |
+---------+------------+----------------+-------------+---------------------+------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

ANALYZE TABLE t PREDICATE COLUMNS;
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.03 sec)

-- Specify `last_analyzed_at IS NOT NULL` to show the columns for which statistics have been collected.
SHOW COLUMN_STATS_USAGE WHERE db_name = 'test' AND table_name = 't' AND last_analyzed_at IS NOT NULL;
+---------+------------+----------------+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| Db_name | Table_name | Partition_name | Column_name | Last_used_at        | Last_analyzed_at    |
+---------+------------+----------------+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| test    | t          |                | b           | 2022-01-05 17:21:33 | 2022-01-05 17:23:06 |
| test    | t          |                | c           | NULL                | 2022-01-05 17:23:06 |
| test    | t          |                | d           | NULL                | 2022-01-05 17:23:06 |
+---------+------------+----------------+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

#### Collect statistics on indexes

To collect statistics on all indexes in `IndexNameList` in `TableName`, use the following syntax:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
ANALYZE TABLE TableName INDEX [IndexNameList] [WITH NUM BUCKETS|TOPN|CMSKETCH DEPTH|CMSKETCH WIDTH]|[WITH NUM SAMPLES|WITH FLOATNUM SAMPLERATE];
```

When `IndexNameList` is empty, this syntax collects statistics on all indexes in `TableName`.

> **Note:**
>
> To ensure that the statistical information before and after the collection is consistent, when `tidb_analyze_version` is `2`, this syntax collects statistics on the entire table (including all columns and indexes), instead of only on indexes.

#### Collect statistics on partitions

- To collect statistics on all partitions in `PartitionNameList` in `TableName`, use the following syntax:

    {{< copyable "sql" >}}

    ```sql
    ANALYZE TABLE TableName PARTITION PartitionNameList [WITH NUM BUCKETS|TOPN|CMSKETCH DEPTH|CMSKETCH WIDTH]|[WITH NUM SAMPLES|WITH FLOATNUM SAMPLERATE];
    ```

- To collect index statistics on all partitions in `PartitionNameList` in `TableName`, use the following syntax:

    {{< copyable "sql" >}}

    ```sql
    ANALYZE TABLE TableName PARTITION PartitionNameList INDEX [IndexNameList] [WITH NUM BUCKETS|TOPN|CMSKETCH DEPTH|CMSKETCH WIDTH]|[WITH NUM SAMPLES|WITH FLOATNUM SAMPLERATE];
    ```

- If you only need to [collect statistics on some columns](/statistics.md#collect-statistics-on-some-columns) of some partitions in a table, use the following syntax:

    > **Warning:**
    >
    > Currently, collecting statistics on `PREDICATE COLUMNS` is an experimental feature. It is not recommended that you use it in production environments.

    {{< copyable "sql" >}}

    ```sql
    ANALYZE TABLE TableName PARTITION PartitionNameList [COLUMNS ColumnNameList|PREDICATE COLUMNS|ALL COLUMNS] [WITH NUM BUCKETS|TOPN|CMSKETCH DEPTH|CMSKETCH WIDTH]|[WITH NUM SAMPLES|WITH FLOATNUM SAMPLERATE];
    ```

#### Collect statistics of partitioned tables in dynamic pruning mode

When accessing partitioned tables in [dynamic pruning mode](/partitioned-table.md#dynamic-pruning-mode), TiDB collects table-level statistics, which is called GlobalStats. Currently, GlobalStats is aggregated from statistics of all partitions. In dynamic pruning mode, a statistics update of any partitioned table can trigger the GlobalStats to be updated.

> **Note:**
>
> - When GlobalStats update is triggered and [`tidb_skip_missing_partition_stats`](/system-variables.md#tidb_skip_missing_partition_stats-new-in-v730) is `OFF`:
>
>     - If some partitions have no statistics (such as a new partition that has never been analyzed), GlobalStats generation is interrupted and a warning message is displayed saying that no statistics are available on partitions.
>     - If statistics of some columns are absent in specific partitions (different columns are specified for analyzing in these partitions), GlobalStats generation is interrupted when statistics of these columns are aggregated, and a warning message is displayed saying that statistics of some columns are absent in specific partitions.
>
> - When GlobalStats update is triggered and [`tidb_skip_missing_partition_stats`](/system-variables.md#tidb_skip_missing_partition_stats-new-in-v730) is `ON`:
>
>     If statistics of all or some columns are missing for some partitions, TiDB skips these missing partition statistics when generating GlobalStats so the generation of GlobalStats is not affected.
>
> - In dynamic pruning mode, the Analyze configurations of partitions and tables should be the same. Therefore, if you specify the `COLUMNS` configuration following the `ANALYZE TABLE TableName PARTITION PartitionNameList` statement or the `OPTIONS` configuration following `WITH`, TiDB will ignore them and return a warning.

### Automatic update

<CustomContent platform="tidb">

For the `INSERT`, `DELETE`, or `UPDATE` statements, TiDB automatically updates the number of rows and modified rows. TiDB persists this information regularly and the update cycle is 20 * [`stats-lease`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#stats-lease). The default value of `stats-lease` is `3s`. If you specify the value as `0`, TiDB stops updating statistics automatically.

</CustomContent>

<CustomContent platform="tidb-cloud">

For the `INSERT`, `DELETE`, or `UPDATE` statements, TiDB automatically updates the number of rows and modified rows. TiDB persists this information regularly and the update cycle is 20 * `stats-lease`. The default value of `stats-lease` is `3s`.

</CustomContent>

### Relevant system variables

Three system variables related to automatic update of statistics are as follows:

|  System Variable | Default Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [`tidb_auto_analyze_ratio`](/system-variables.md#tidb_auto_analyze_ratio) | 0.5 | The threshold value of automatic update |
| [`tidb_auto_analyze_start_time`](/system-variables.md#tidb_auto_analyze_start_time) | `00:00 +0000` | The start time in a day when TiDB can perform automatic update |
| [`tidb_auto_analyze_end_time`](/system-variables.md#tidb_auto_analyze_end_time)   | `23:59 +0000` | The end time in a day when TiDB can perform automatic update |
| [`tidb_auto_analyze_partition_batch_size`](/system-variables.md#tidb_auto_analyze_partition_batch_size-new-in-v640) | `1` | The number of partitions that TiDB automatically analyzes when analyzing a partitioned table (that is, when automatically updating statistics on a partitioned table) |
| [`tidb_enable_auto_analyze_priority_queue`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_auto_analyze_priority_queue-new-in-v800) | `ON` | Controls whether to enable the priority queue to schedule the tasks of automatically collecting statistics. When this variable is enabled, TiDB prioritizes collecting statistics for tables that are more valuable to collect, such as newly created indexes and partitioned tables with partition changes. Additionally, TiDB prioritizes tables with lower health scores, placing them at the front of the queue. |

When the ratio of the number of modified rows to the total number of rows of `tbl` in a table is greater than `tidb_auto_analyze_ratio`, and the current time is between `tidb_auto_analyze_start_time` and `tidb_auto_analyze_end_time`, TiDB executes the `ANALYZE TABLE tbl` statement in the background to automatically update the statistics on this table.

To avoid the situation that modifying a small amount of data on a small table frequently triggers the automatic update, when a table has less than 1000 rows, such data modifying does not trigger the automatic update in TiDB. You can use the `SHOW STATS_META` statement to view the number of rows in a table.

> **Note:**
>
> Currently, the automatic update does not record the configuration items input at manual `ANALYZE`. Therefore, when you use the `WITH` syntax to control the collecting behavior of `ANALYZE`, you need to manually set scheduled tasks to collect statistics.

#### Disable automatic update

If you find that automatic update of statistics consumes excessive resources and affects online application operations, you can disable it using the [`tidb_enable_auto_analyze`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_auto_analyze-new-in-v610) system variable.

#### Terminate background `ANALYZE` tasks

Since TiDB v6.0, TiDB supports using the `KILL` statement to terminate an `ANALYZE` task running in the background. If you find that an `ANALYZE` task running in the background consumes a lot of resources and affects your application, you can terminate the `ANALYZE` task by taking the following steps:

1. Execute the following SQL statement:

    {{< copyable "sql" >}}

    ```sql
    SHOW ANALYZE STATUS
    ```

    By checking the `instance` column and the `process_id` column in the result, you can get the TiDB instance address and the task `ID` of the background `ANALYZE` task.

2. Terminate the `ANALYZE` task that is running in the background.

    <CustomContent platform="tidb">

    - If [`enable-global-kill`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#enable-global-kill-new-in-v610) is `true` (`true` by default), you can execute the `KILL TIDB ${id};` statement directly, where `${id}` is the `ID` of the background `ANALYZE` task obtained from the previous step.
    - If `enable-global-kill` is `false`, you need to use a client to connect to the TiDB instance that is executing the backend `ANALYZE` task, and then execute the `KILL TIDB ${id};` statement. If you use a client to connect to another TiDB instance, or if there is a proxy between the client and the TiDB cluster, the `KILL` statement cannot terminate the background `ANALYZE` task.

    </CustomContent>

    <CustomContent platform="tidb-cloud">

    To terminate the `ANALYZE` task, you can execute the `KILL TIDB ${id};` statement, where `${id}` is the `ID` of the background `ANALYZE` task obtained from the previous step.

    </CustomContent>

For more information on the `KILL` statement, see [`KILL`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-kill.md).

### Control `ANALYZE` concurrency

When you run the `ANALYZE` statement, you can adjust the concurrency using system variables, to control its effect on the system.

The relationships of the relevant system variables are shown below:

![analyze_concurrency](/media/analyze_concurrency.png)

`tidb_build_stats_concurrency`, `tidb_build_sampling_stats_concurrency`, and `tidb_analyze_partition_concurrency` are in an upstream-downstream relationship, as shown in the preceding diagram. The actual total concurrency is: `tidb_build_stats_concurrency` * (`tidb_build_sampling_stats_concurrency` + `tidb_analyze_partition_concurrency`). When modifying these variables, you need to consider their respective values at the same time. It is recommended to adjust them one by one in the order of `tidb_analyze_partition_concurrency`, `tidb_build_sampling_stats_concurrency`, `tidb_build_stats_concurrency`, and observe the impact on the system. The larger the values of these three variables, the greater the resource overhead on the system.

#### `tidb_build_stats_concurrency`

When you run the `ANALYZE` statement, the task is divided into multiple small tasks. Each task only works on statistics of one column or index. You can use the [`tidb_build_stats_concurrency`](/system-variables.md#tidb_build_stats_concurrency) variable to control the number of simultaneous small tasks. The default value is `2`. The default value is `4` for v7.4.0 and earlier versions.

#### `tidb_build_sampling_stats_concurrency`

When analyzing ordinary columns, you can use [`tidb_build_sampling_stats_concurrency`](/system-variables.md#tidb_build_sampling_stats_concurrency-new-in-v750) to control the concurrency of executing sampling tasks. The default value is `2`.

#### `tidb_analyze_partition_concurrency`

When running the `ANALYZE` statement, you can use [`tidb_analyze_partition_concurrency`](/system-variables.md#tidb_analyze_partition_concurrency) to control the concurrency of reading and writing statistics for a partitioned table. The default value is `2`. The default value is `1` for v7.4.0 and earlier versions.

#### `tidb_distsql_scan_concurrency`

When you analyze regular columns, you can use the [`tidb_distsql_scan_concurrency`](/system-variables.md#tidb_distsql_scan_concurrency) variable to control the number of Regions to be read at one time. The default value is `15`. Note that changing the value will affect query performance. Adjust the value carefully.

#### `tidb_index_serial_scan_concurrency`

When you analyze index columns, you can use the [`tidb_index_serial_scan_concurrency`](/system-variables.md#tidb_index_serial_scan_concurrency) variable to control the number of Regions to be read at one time. The default value is `1`. Note that changing the value will affect query performance. Adjust the value carefully.

### Persist ANALYZE configurations

Since v5.4.0, TiDB supports persisting some `ANALYZE` configurations. With this feature, the existing configurations can be easily reused for future statistics collection.

The following are the `ANALYZE` configurations that support persistence:

| Configurations | Corresponding ANALYZE syntax |
| --- | --- |
| The number of histogram buckets | WITH NUM BUCKETS |
| The number of Top-N  | WITH NUM TOPN |
| The number of samples | WITH NUM SAMPLES |
| The sampling rate | WITH FLOATNUM SAMPLERATE |
| The `ANALYZE` column type | AnalyzeColumnOption ::= ( 'ALL COLUMNS' \| 'PREDICATE COLUMNS' \| 'COLUMNS' ColumnNameList ) |
| The `ANALYZE` column | ColumnNameList ::= Identifier ( ',' Identifier )* |

#### Enable ANALYZE configuration persistence

<CustomContent platform="tidb">

The `ANALYZE` configuration persistence feature is enabled by default (the system variable `tidb_analyze_version` is `2` and `tidb_persist_analyze_options` is `ON` by default).

</CustomContent>

<CustomContent platform="tidb-cloud">

The `ANALYZE` configuration persistence feature is disabled by default. To enable the feature, ensure that the system variable `tidb_persist_analyze_options` is `ON` and set the system variable `tidb_analyze_version` to `2`.

</CustomContent>

You can use this feature to record the persistence configurations specified in the `ANALYZE` statement when executing the statement manually. Once recorded, the next time TiDB automatically updates statistics or you manually collect statistics without specifying these configuration, TiDB will collect statistics according to the recorded configurations.

To query the configuration persisted on a specific table used for auto analyze operations, you can use the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT sample_num, sample_rate, buckets, topn, column_choice, column_ids FROM mysql.analyze_options opt JOIN information_schema.tables tbl ON opt.table_id = tbl.tidb_table_id WHERE tbl.table_schema = '{db_name}' AND tbl.table_name = '{table_name}';
```

TiDB will overwrite the previously recorded persistent configuration using the new configurations specified by the latest `ANALYZE` statement. For example, if you run `ANALYZE TABLE t WITH 200 TOPN;`, it will set the top 200 values in the `ANALYZE` statement. Subsequently, executing `ANALYZE TABLE t WITH 0.1 SAMPLERATE;` will set both the top 200 values and a sampling rate of 0.1 for auto `ANALYZE` statements, similar to `ANALYZE TABLE t WITH 200 TOPN, 0.1 SAMPLERATE;`.

#### Disable ANALYZE configuration persistence

To disable the `ANALYZE` configuration persistence feature, set the `tidb_persist_analyze_options` system variable to `OFF`. Because the `ANALYZE` configuration persistence feature is not applicable to `tidb_analyze_version = 1`, setting `tidb_analyze_version = 1` can also disable the feature.

After disabling the `ANALYZE` configuration persistence feature, TiDB does not clear the persisted configuration records. Therefore, if you enable this feature again, TiDB continues to collect statistics using the previously recorded persistent configurations.

> **Note:**
>
> When you enable the `ANALYZE` configuration persistence feature again, if the previously recorded persistence configurations are no longer applicable to the latest data, you need to execute the `ANALYZE` statement manually and specify the new persistence configurations.

### The memory quota for collecting statistics

> **Warning:**
>
> Currently, the `ANALYZE` memory quota is an experimental feature, and the memory statistics might be inaccurate in production environments.

Since TiDB v6.1.0, you can use the system variable [`tidb_mem_quota_analyze`](/system-variables.md#tidb_mem_quota_analyze-new-in-v610) to control the memory quota for collecting statistics in TiDB.

To set a proper value of `tidb_mem_quota_analyze`, consider the data size of the cluster. When the default sampling rate is used, the main considerations are the number of columns, the size of column values, and the memory configuration of TiDB. Consider the following suggestions when you configure the maximum and minimum values:

> **Note:**
>
> The following suggestions are for reference only. You need to configure the values based on the real scenario.

- Minimum value: should be greater than the maximum memory usage when TiDB collects statistics from the table with the most columns. An approximate reference: when TiDB collects statistics from a table with 20 columns using the default configuration, the maximum memory usage is about 800 MiB; when TiDB collects statistics from a table with 160 columns using the default configuration, the maximum memory usage is about 5 GiB.
- Maximum value: should be less than the available memory when TiDB is not collecting statistics.

### View `ANALYZE` state

When executing the `ANALYZE` statement, you can view the current state of `ANALYZE` using the following SQL statement:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SHOW ANALYZE STATUS [ShowLikeOrWhere]
```

This statement returns the state of `ANALYZE`. You can use `ShowLikeOrWhere` to filter the information you need.

Currently, the `SHOW ANALYZE STATUS` statement returns the following 11 columns:

| Column name | Description            |
| :-------- | :------------- |
| table_schema  |  The database name    |
| table_name | The table name |
| partition_name| The partition name |
| job_info | The task information. If an index is analyzed, this information will include the index name. When `tidb_analyze_version =2`, this information will include configuration items such as sample rate. |
| processed_rows | The number of rows that have been analyzed |
| start_time | The time at which the task starts |
| state | The state of a task, including `pending`, `running`, `finished`, and `failed` |
| fail_reason | The reason why the task fails. If the execution is successful, the value is `NULL`. |
| instance | The TiDB instance that executes the task |
| process_id | The process ID that executes the task |

Starting from TiDB v6.1.0, the `SHOW ANALYZE STATUS` statement supports showing cluster-level tasks. Even after a TiDB restart, you can still view task records before the restart using this statement. Before TiDB v6.1.0, the `SHOW ANALYZE STATUS` statement can only show instance-level tasks, and task records are cleared after a TiDB restart.

`SHOW ANALYZE STATUS` shows the most recent task records only. Starting from TiDB v6.1.0, you can view the history tasks within the last 7 days through the system table `mysql.analyze_jobs`.

When [`tidb_mem_quota_analyze`](/system-variables.md#tidb_mem_quota_analyze-new-in-v610) is set and an automatic `ANALYZE` task running in the TiDB background uses more memory than this threshold, the task will be retried. You can see failed and retried tasks in the output of the `SHOW ANALYZE STATUS` statement.

When [`tidb_max_auto_analyze_time`](/system-variables.md#tidb_max_auto_analyze_time-new-in-v610) is greater than 0 and an automatic `ANALYZE` task running in the TiDB background takes more time than this threshold, the task will be terminated.

```sql
mysql> SHOW ANALYZE STATUS [ShowLikeOrWhere];
+--------------+------------+----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+---------------------+---------------------+----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Table_schema | Table_name | Partition_name | Job_info                                                                                  | Processed_rows | Start_time          | End_time            | State    | Fail_reason                                                                   |

```

## View statistics

You can view the statistics status using the following statements.

### Metadata of tables

You can use the `SHOW STATS_META` statement to view the total number of rows and the number of updated rows.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SHOW STATS_META [ShowLikeOrWhere];
```

The syntax of `ShowLikeOrWhereOpt` is as follows:

![ShowLikeOrWhereOpt](/media/sqlgram/ShowLikeOrWhereOpt.png)

Currently, the `SHOW STATS_META` statement returns the following 6 columns:

| Column name | Description  |
| :-------- | :------------- |
| `db_name`  |  The database name    |
| `table_name` | The table name |
| `partition_name`| The partition name |
| `update_time` | The time of the update |
| `modify_count` | The number of modified rows |
| `row_count` | The total number of rows |

> **Note:**
>
> When TiDB automatically updates the total number of rows and the number of modified rows according to DML statements, `update_time` is also updated. Therefore, `update_time` does not necessarily indicate the last time when the `ANALYZE` statement is executed.

### Health state of tables

You can use the `SHOW STATS_HEALTHY` statement to check the health state of tables and roughly estimate the accuracy of the statistics. When `modify_count` >= `row_count`, the health state is 0; when `modify_count` < `row_count`, the health state is (1 - `modify_count`/`row_count`) * 100.

The syntax is as follows:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SHOW STATS_HEALTHY [ShowLikeOrWhere];
```

The synopsis of `SHOW STATS_HEALTHY` is:

![ShowStatsHealthy](/media/sqlgram/ShowStatsHealthy.png)

Currently, the `SHOW STATS_HEALTHY` statement returns the following 4 columns:

| Column name | Description  |
| :-------- | :------------- |
| `db_name`  | The database name    |
| `table_name` | The table name |
| `partition_name` | The partition name |
| `healthy` | The health state of tables |

### Metadata of columns

You can use the `SHOW STATS_HISTOGRAMS` statement to view the number of different values and the number of `NULL` in all the columns.

Syntax as follows:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SHOW STATS_HISTOGRAMS [ShowLikeOrWhere]
```

This statement returns the number of different values and the number of `NULL` in all the columns. You can use `ShowLikeOrWhere` to filter the information you need.

Currently, the `SHOW STATS_HISTOGRAMS` statement returns the following 10 columns:

| Column name | Description    |
| :-------- | :------------- |
| `db_name`  |  The database name    |
| `table_name` | The table name |
| `partition_name` | The partition name |
| `column_name` | The column name (when `is_index` is `0`) or the index name (when `is_index` is `1`) |
| `is_index` | Whether it is an index column or not |
| `update_time` | The time of the update |
| `distinct_count` | The number of different values |
| `null_count` | The number of `NULL` |
| `avg_col_size` | The average length of columns |
| correlation | The Pearson correlation coefficient of the column and the integer primary key, which indicates the degree of association between the two columns|

### Buckets of histogram

You can use the `SHOW STATS_BUCKETS` statement to view each bucket of the histogram.

The syntax is as follows:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SHOW STATS_BUCKETS [ShowLikeOrWhere]
```

The diagram is as follows:

![SHOW STATS_BUCKETS](/media/sqlgram/SHOW_STATS_BUCKETS.png)

This statement returns information about all the buckets. You can use `ShowLikeOrWhere` to filter the information you need.

Currently, the `SHOW STATS_BUCKETS` statement returns the following 11 columns:

| Column name | Description   |
| :-------- | :------------- |
| `db_name`  |  The database name    |
| `table_name` | The table name |
| `partition_name` | The partition name |
| `column_name` | The column name (when `is_index` is `0`) or the index name (when `is_index` is `1`) |
| `is_index` | Whether it is an index column or not |
| `bucket_id` | The ID of a bucket |
| `count` | The number of all the values that falls on the bucket and the previous buckets |
| `repeats` | The occurrence number of the maximum value |
| `lower_bound` | The minimum value |
| `upper_bound` | The maximum value |
| `ndv` | The number of different values in the bucket. When `tidb_analyze_version` = `1`, `ndv` is always `0`, which has no actual meaning. |

### Top-N information

You can use the `SHOW STATS_TOPN` statement to view the Top-N information currently collected by TiDB.

The syntax is as follows:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SHOW STATS_TOPN [ShowLikeOrWhere];
```

Currently, the `SHOW STATS_TOPN` statement returns the following 7 columns:

| Column name | Description |
| ---- | ----|
| `db_name` | The database name |
| `table_name` | The table name |
| `partition_name` | The partition name |
| `column_name` | The column name (when `is_index` is `0`) or the index name (when `is_index` is `1`) |
| `is_index` | Whether it is an index column or not |
| `value` | The value of this column |
| `count` | How many times the value appears |

## Delete statistics

You can run the `DROP STATS` statement to delete statistics.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
DROP STATS TableName
```

The preceding statement deletes all statistics of `TableName`. If a partitioned table is specified, this statement will delete statistics of all partitions in this table as well as GlobalStats generated in dynamic pruning mode.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
DROP STATS TableName PARTITION PartitionNameList;
```

This preceding statement only deletes statistics of the specified partitions in `PartitionNameList`.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
DROP STATS TableName GLOBAL;
```

The preceding statement only deletes GlobalStats generated in dynamic pruning mode of the specified table.

## Load statistics

> **Note:**
>
> Loading statistics is not available on [TiDB Serverless](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/select-cluster-tier#tidb-serverless) clusters.

By default, depending on the size of column statistics, TiDB loads statistics differently as follows:

- For statistics that consume small amounts of memory (such as count, distinctCount, and nullCount), as long as the column data is updated, TiDB automatically loads the corresponding statistics into memory for use in the SQL optimization stage.
- For statistics that consume large amounts of memory (such as histograms, TopN, and Count-Min Sketch), to ensure the performance of SQL execution, TiDB loads the statistics asynchronously on demand. Take histograms as an example. TiDB loads histogram statistics on a column into memory only when the optimizer uses the histogram statistics on that column. On-demand asynchronous statistics loading does not affect the performance of SQL execution but might provide incomplete statistics for SQL optimization.

Since v5.4.0, TiDB introduces the synchronously loading statistics feature. This feature allows TiDB to synchronously load large-sized statistics (such as histograms, TopN, and Count-Min Sketch statistics) into memory when you execute SQL statements, which improves the completeness of statistics for SQL optimization.

To enable this feature, set the value of the [`tidb_stats_load_sync_wait`](/system-variables.md#tidb_stats_load_sync_wait-new-in-v540) system variable to a timeout (in milliseconds) that SQL optimization can wait for at most to synchronously load complete column statistics. The default value of this variable is `100`, indicating that the feature is enabled.

<CustomContent platform="tidb">

After enabling the synchronously loading statistics feature, you can further configure the feature as follows:

- To control how TiDB behaves when the waiting time of SQL optimization reaches the timeout, modify the value of the [`tidb_stats_load_pseudo_timeout`](/system-variables.md#tidb_stats_load_pseudo_timeout-new-in-v540) system variable. The default value of this variable is `ON`, indicating that after the timeout, the SQL optimization process does not use any histogram, TopN, or CMSketch statistics on any columns. If this variable is set to `OFF`, after the timeout, SQL execution fails.
- To specify the maximum number of columns that the synchronously loading statistics feature can process concurrently, modify the value of the [`stats-load-concurrency`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#stats-load-concurrency-new-in-v540) option in the TiDB configuration file. The default value is `5`.
- To specify the maximum number of column requests that the synchronously loading statistics feature can cache, modify the value of the [`stats-load-queue-size`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#stats-load-queue-size-new-in-v540) option in the TiDB configuration file. The default value is `1000`.

During TiDB startup, SQL statements executed before the initial statistics are fully loaded might have suboptimal execution plans, thus causing performance issues. To avoid such issues, TiDB v7.1.0 introduces the configuration parameter [`force-init-stats`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#force-init-stats-new-in-v657-and-v710). With this option, you can control whether TiDB provides services only after statistics initialization has been finished during startup. Starting from v7.2.0, this parameter is enabled by default.

Starting from v7.1.0, TiDB introduces [`lite-init-stats`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#lite-init-stats-new-in-v710) for lightweight statistics initialization.

- When the value of `lite-init-stats` is `true`, statistics initialization does not load any histogram, TopN, or Count-Min Sketch of indexes or columns into memory.
- When the value of `lite-init-stats` is `false`, statistics initialization loads histograms, TopN, and Count-Min Sketch of indexes and primary keys into memory but does not load any histogram, TopN, or Count-Min Sketch of non-primary key columns into memory. When the optimizer needs the histogram, TopN, and Count-Min Sketch of a specific index or column, the necessary statistics are loaded into memory synchronously or asynchronously.

The default value of `lite-init-stats` is `true`, which means to enable lightweight statistics initialization. Setting `lite-init-stats` to `true` speeds up statistics initialization and reduces TiDB memory usage by avoiding unnecessary statistics loading.

<CustomContent platform="tidb-cloud">

After enabling the synchronously loading statistics feature, you can control how TiDB behaves when the waiting time of SQL optimization reaches the timeout by modifing the value of the [`tidb_stats_load_pseudo_timeout`](/system-variables.md#tidb_stats_load_pseudo_timeout-new-in-v540) system variable. The default value of this variable is `ON`, indicating that after the timeout, the SQL optimization process does not use any histogram, TopN, or CMSketch statistics on any columns. If this variable is set to `OFF`, after the timeout, SQL execution fails.

## Import and export statistics

<CustomContent platform="tidb-cloud">

> **Note:**
>
> This section is not applicable to TiDB Cloud.

</CustomContent>

### Export statistics

The interface to export statistics is as follows:

+ To obtain the JSON format statistics of the `${table_name}` table in the `${db_name}` database:

    {{< copyable "" >}}

    ```
    http://${tidb-server-ip}:${tidb-server-status-port}/stats/dump/${db_name}/${table_name}
    ```

    For example:

    {{< copyable "" >}}

    ```
    curl -s http://127.0.0.1:10080/stats/dump/test/t1 -o /tmp/t1.json
    ```

+ To obtain the JSON format statistics of the `${table_name}` table in the `${db_name}` database at specific time:

    {{< copyable "" >}}

    ```
    http://${tidb-server-ip}:${tidb-server-status-port}/stats/dump/${db_name}/${table_name}/${yyyyMMddHHmmss}
    ```

### Import statistics

> **Note:**
>
> When you start the MySQL client, use the `--local-infile=1` option.

Generally, the imported statistics refer to the JSON file obtained using the export interface.

Syntax:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```
LOAD STATS 'file_name'
```

`file_name` is the file name of the statistics to be imported.

## Lock statistics

Starting from v6.5.0, TiDB supports locking statistics. After the statistics of a table or a partition are locked, the statistics of the table cannot be modified and the `ANALYZE` statement cannot be executed on the table. For example:

Create table `t`, and insert data into it. When the statistics of table `t` are not locked, the `ANALYZE` statement can be successfully executed.

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t(a INT, b INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), (7,8);
Query OK, 4 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 4  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> ANALYZE TABLE t;
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.02 sec)

mysql> SHOW WARNINGS;
+-------+------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Level | Code | Message                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

+-------+------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Lock the statistics of table `t` and execute `ANALYZE`. The warning message shows that the `ANALYZE` statement has skipped table `t`.

```sql
mysql> LOCK STATS t;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SHOW STATS_LOCKED;
+---------+------------+----------------+--------+
| Db_name | Table_name | Partition_name | Status |

+---------+------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Unlock the statistics of table `t` and `ANALYZE` can be successfully executed again.

```sql
mysql> UNLOCK STATS t;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> ANALYZE TABLE t;
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.03 sec)

mysql> SHOW WARNINGS;
+-------+------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Level | Code | Message                                                                                                                                 |
+-------+------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Note  | 1105 | Analyze use auto adjusted sample rate 1.000000 for table test.t, reason to use this rate is "use min(1, 110000/8) as the sample-rate=1" |
+-------+------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

In addition, you can also lock the statistics of a partition using `LOCK STATS`. For example:

Create a partition table `t`, and insert data into it. When the statistics of partition `p1` are not locked, the `ANALYZE` statement can be successfully executed.

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t(a INT, b INT) PARTITION BY RANGE (a) (PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (10), PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (20), PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (30));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), (7,8);
Query OK, 4 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 4  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> ANALYZE TABLE t;
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 6 warning (0.02 sec)

### Behaviors of locking statistics

* If you lock the statistics on a partitioned table, the statistics of all partitions on the partitioned table are locked.
* If you truncate a table or partition, the statistics lock on the table or partition will be released.

The following table describes the behaviors of locking statistics:

| | Delete the whole table | Truncate the whole table | Truncate a partition | Create a new partition | Delete a partition | Reorganize a partition | Exchange a partition |
|----------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| A non-partitioned table is locked | The lock is invalid | The lock is invalid because TiDB deletes the old table, so the lock information is also deleted | / | / | / | / | / |
| A partitioned table and the whole table is locked | The lock is invalid | The lock is invalid because TiDB deletes the old table, so the lock information is also deleted | The old partition lock information is invalid, and the new partition is automatically locked | The new partition is automatically locked | The lock information of the deleted partition is cleared, and the lock of the whole table continues to take effect | The lock information of the deleted partition is cleared, and the new partition is automatically locked | The lock information is transferred to the exchanged table, and the new partition is automatically locked |
| A partitioned table and only some partitions are locked | The lock is invalid | The lock is invalid because TiDB deletes the old table, so the lock information is also deleted | The lock is invalid because TiDB deletes the old table, so the lock information is also deleted | / | The deleted partition lock information is cleared | The deleted partition lock information is cleared | The lock information is transferred to the exchanged table |
