> **Warning:**

> **Note:**
>
> The vector search feature is only available for TiDB Self-Managed clusters and [TiDB Cloud Serverless](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/select-cluster-tier#tidb-cloud-serverless) clusters.

- Each [vector](/vector-search-data-types.md) supports up to 16383 dimensions.
- You cannot store `NaN`, `Infinity`, or `-Infinity` values in the vector data type.
- Only cosine distance and L2 distance (Euclidean distance) are supported when you create a [vector search index](/vector-search-index.md).
- Vector data types cannot store double-precision floating-point numbers ï¼ˆthis is planned to be supported in a future release). If you insert or store double-precision floating-point numbers in Vector columns, they are converted to single-precision floating-point numbers.
