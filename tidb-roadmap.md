# TiDB Roadmap

This is a look into the proposed future. We will update this as we release long-term stable (LTS) releases. The purpose is to provide visibility into what is coming you can more closely follow progress, learn about key milestones as we go, and for us to get feedback as development happens. 

In the course of development, this roadmap is subject to change based on user needs and feedback. As expected, as the columns move right, the items under them are less committed. If you have a feature request or want to prioritize a feature, please file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues).
