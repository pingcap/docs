# TiDB Roadmap

This roadmap provides a look into the proposed future. This will be continually updated as we release long-term stable (LTS) versions. The purpose is to provide visibility into what is coming, so that you can more closely follow the progress, learn about the key milestones on the way, and give feedback as the development work goes on.

In the course of development, this roadmap is subject to change based on user needs and feedback. As expected, as the columns move right, the items under them are less committed. If you have a feature request or want to prioritize a feature, please file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues).

            <b>Distributed eXecution Framework (DXF)</b><br /><i>
            In v7.1.0, TiDB introduced the DXF for tasks (such as DDL and analyze). This is the foundation for parallelizing these tasks across compute nodes. v7.4.0 introduces global sorting in distributed re-organization tasks (such as DDL and import), which greatly mitigates extra resource consumption in storage. Optionally, external shared storage can be leveraged for simplicity and cost savings.</i>
