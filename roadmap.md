## TiKV

+ Raft
    - [x] Region Merge - Merge small Regions together to reduce overhead
    - [x] Local Read Thread - Process read requests in a local read thread
    - [x] Split Region in Batch - Speed up Region split for large Regions
    - [x] Raft Learner - Support Raft learner to smooth the configuration change process
    - [x] Raft Pre-vote - Support Raft pre-vote to avoid unnecessary leader election on network isolation
    - [ ] Joint Consensus - Change multi members safely.
    - [ ] Multi-thread Raftstore - Process Region Raft logic in multiple threads
    - [ ] Multi-thread apply pool - Apply Region Raft committed entries in multiple threads
+ Engine
    - [ ] Titan - Separate large key-values from LSM-Tree
    - [ ] Pluggable Engine Interface - Clean up the engine wrapper code and provide more extensibility
+ Storage
    - [ ] Flow Control - Do flow control in scheduler to avoid write stall in advance
+ Transaction
    - [x] Optimize transaction conflicts
    - [ ] Distributed GC - Distribute MVCC garbage collection control to TiKV
+ Coprocessor
    - [x] Streaming - Cut large data set into small chunks to optimize memory consumption
    - [ ] Chunk Execution - Process data in chunk to improve performance
    - [ ] Request Tracing - Provide per-request execution details
+ Tools
    - [x] TiKV Importer - Speed up data importing by SST file ingestion
+ Client
    - [ ] TiKV client (Rust crate)
    - [ ] Batch gRPC Message - Reduce message overhead

## PD

- [x] Improve namespace
    - [x] Different replication policies for different namespaces and tables
- [x] Decentralize scheduling table Regions
- [x] Scheduler supports prioritization to be more controllable
- [ ] Use machine learning to optimize scheduling
- [ ] Optimize Region metadata - Save Region metadata in detached storage engine

## TiSpark

- [ ] Limit/Order push-down
- [x] Access through the DAG interface and deprecate the Select interface
- [ ] Index Join and parallel merge join
- [ ] Data Federation

## Tools

- [X] Tool for automating TiDB deployment
- [X] High-Performance data import tool (lightning)
- [X] Backup and restore tool (incremental backup supported by drainer, incremental restore supported by reparo)
- [X] New TiDB-binlog with improved architecture
- [ ] Data online migration tool (premium edition of Syncer)
- [ ] Diagnostic tools
