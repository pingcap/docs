title: UUID Best Practices
summary: UUIDs, when used as primary keys, offer benefits such as reduced network trips, support in most programming languages and databases, and protection against enumeration attacks. Storing UUIDs as binary in a `BINARY(16)` column is recommended. It's also advised to avoid setting the `swap_flag` with TiDB to prevent hotspots. MySQL compatibility is available for UUIDs.

# UUID Best Practices

## Overview of UUIDs

When used as a primary key, instead of an [`AUTO_INCREMENT`](/auto-increment.md) integer value, a universally unique identifier (UUID) delivers the following benefits:

- UUIDs can be generated on multiple systems without risking conflicts. In some cases, this means that the number of network trips to TiDB can be reduced, leading to improved performance.
- UUIDs are supported by most programming languages and database systems.
- When used as a part of a URL, a UUID is not vulnerable to enumeration attacks. In comparison, with an `AUTO_INCREMENT` number, it is possible to guess the invoice IDs or user IDs.

## Best practices

### Store as binary

The textual UUID format looks like this: `ab06f63e-8fe7-11ec-a514-5405db7aad56`, which is a string of 36 characters. By using [`UUID_TO_BIN()`](/functions-and-operators/miscellaneous-functions.md#uuid_to_bin), the textual format can be converted into a binary format of 16 bytes. This allows you to store the text in a [`BINARY(16)`](/data-type-string.md#binary-type) column. When retrieving the UUID, you can use the [`BIN_TO_UUID()`](/functions-and-operators/miscellaneous-functions.md#bin_to_uuid) function to get back to the textual format.

### UUID format binary order and a clustered PK

The `UUID_TO_BIN()` function can be used with one argument, the UUID or with two arguments where the second argument is a `swap_flag`.

It is recommended to not set the `swap_flag` with TiDB to avoid [hotspots](/best-practices/high-concurrency-best-practices.md).

You can also explicitly set the [`CLUSTERED` option](/clustered-indexes.md) for UUID based primary keys to avoid hotspots.

To demonstrate the effect of the `swap_flag`, here are two tables with an identical structure. The difference is that the data inserted into `uuid_demo_1` uses `UUID_TO_BIN(?, 0)` and `uuid_demo_2` uses `UUID_TO_BIN(?, 1)`.

In the screenshot of the [Key Visualizer](/dashboard/dashboard-key-visualizer.md) below, you can see that writes are concentrated in a single region of the `uuid_demo_2` table that has the order of the fields swapped in the binary format.

```sql
CREATE TABLE `uuid_demo_1` (
  `uuid` varbinary(16) NOT NULL,
  `c1` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`uuid`) CLUSTERED
)
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE `uuid_demo_2` (
  `uuid` varbinary(16) NOT NULL,
  `c1` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`uuid`) CLUSTERED
)
```

## MySQL compatibility

UUIDs can be used in MySQL as well. The `BIN_TO_UUID()` and `UUID_TO_BIN()` functions were introduced in MySQL 8.0. The `UUID()` function is available in earlier MySQL versions as well.
