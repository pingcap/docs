# sync-diff-inspector User Guide

[sync-diff-inspector](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-tools/tree/master/sync_diff_inspector) is a tool used to compare data stored in the databases with the MySQL protocol. For example, it can compare the data in MySQL with that in TiDB, the data in MySQL with that in MySQL, or the data in TiDB with that in TiDB. In addition, you can also use this tool to repair data in the scenario where a small amount of data is inconsistent.

This guide introduces the key features of sync-diff-inspector and describes how to configure and use this tool. To download sync-diff-inspector, use one of the following methods:

+ Binary package. Click [tidb-enterprise-tools-nightly-linux-amd64](https://download.pingcap.org/tidb-enterprise-tools-nightly-linux-amd64.tar.gz) to download.
+ Docker image. Execute the following command to download:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    docker pull pingcap/tidb-enterprise-tools:nightly
    ```

## Key features

* Compare the table schema and data
* Generate the SQL statements used to repair data if the data inconsistency exists
* Support [data check for tables with different schema or table names](/sync-diff-inspector/route-diff.md)
* Support [data check in the sharding scenario](/sync-diff-inspector/shard-diff.md)
* Support [data check for TiDB upstream-downstream clusters](/sync-diff-inspector/upstream-downstream-diff.md)
* Support [data check in the DM replication scenario](/sync-diff-inspector/dm-diff.md)

## Restrictions of sync-diff-inspector

* Online check is not supported for data migration between MySQL and TiDB. Ensure that no data is written into the upstream-downstream checklist, and that data in a certain range is not changed. You can check data in this range by setting `range`.

* `JSON`, `BIT`, `BINARY`, `BLOB` and other types of data are not supported. When you perform a data check, you need to set `ignore-columns` to skip checking these types of data.

* In TiDB and MySQL, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE` and other floating-point types are implemented differently. `FLOAT` and `DOUBLE` respectively take 6 and 15 significant digits for calculating checksum. If you do not want to use this feature, set `ignore-columns` to skip checking these columns.

* Support checking tables that do not contain the primary key or the unique index. However, if data is inconsistent, the generated SQL statements might not be able to repair the data correctly.

## Database privileges for sync-diff-inspector

sync-diff-inspector needs to obtain the information of table schema and to query data. The required database privileges are as follows:

* Upstream database
    - `SELECT` (checks data for comparison)
    - `SHOW_DATABASES` (views database name)
    - `RELOAD` (views table schema)
* Downstream database
    - `SELECT` (checks data for comparison)
    - `SHOW_DATABASES` (views database name)
    - `RELOAD` (views table schema)

## Configuration file description

The configuration of sync-diff-inspector consists of the following parts:

- `Global config`: General configurations, such as number of threads to check, whether to export SQL statement to fix inconsistent tables, and whether to campare the data.
- `Databases config`: Configures the instances of the upstream and downstream databases.
- `Routes`: Rules for upstream multiple schema names to match downstream single schema names **(optional)**.
- `Task config`: Configures the tables for checking. If some tables have a certain mapping relationship between the upstream and downstream databases or have some special requirements, you must configure these tables.
- `Table config`: Special configurations for specific tables, such as specified ranges and columns to be ignored **(optional)**.

Below is the description of a complete configuration file:

- Note: configurations with `s` after their name can have multiple values, so you need to use square brackets `[]` to contain the configuration values.

## Run sync-diff-inspector

Run the following command:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```bash
./sync_diff_inspector --config=./config.toml
```

This command outputs a check report `summary.txt` in the `output-dir` of `config.toml` and the log `sync_diff.log`. In the `output-dir`, a folder named by the hash value of the `config. toml` file is also generated. This folder includes the checkpoint node information of breakpoints and the SQL file generated when the data is inconsistent.

### Progress information

sync-diff-inspector sends progress information to `stdout` when running. Progress information includes the comparison results of table structures, comparison results of table data and the progress bar.

```

### Output file

The directory structure of the output file is as follows:

```
output/
|-- checkpoint # Saves the breakpoint information
| |-- bbfec8cc8d1f58a5800e63aa73e5 # Config hash. The placeholder file which identifies the configuration file corresponding to the output directory (output/)
│ |-- DO_NOT_EDIT_THIS_DIR
│ └-- sync_diff_checkpoints.pb # The breakpoint information
|
|-- fix-on-target # Saves SQL files to fix data inconsistency
| |-- xxx.sql
| |-- xxx.sql
| └-- xxx.sql
|
|-- summary.txt # Saves the summary of the check results
└-- sync_diff.log # Saves the output log informatiion when sync-diff-inspector is running
```

### Log

The log of sync-diff-inspector is saved in `${output}/sync_diff.log`, among which `${output}` is the value of `output-dir` in the `config.toml` file.

### Progress

The running sync-diff-inspector periodically (every 10 seconds) prints the progress in checkpoint, which is located at `${output}/checkpoint/sync_diff_checkpoints.pb`, among which `${output}` is the value of `output-dir` in the `config.toml` file.

### Result

After the check is finished, sync-diff-inspector outputs a report. It is located at `${output}/summary.txt`, and `${output}` is the value of `output-dir` in the `config.toml` file.

```summary
+---------------------+--------------------+----------------+
|        TABLE        | STRUCTURE EQUALITY | DATA DIFF ROWS |
+---------------------+--------------------+----------------+
| `sbtest`.`sbtest99` | true               | +97/-97        |
| `sbtest`.`sbtest96` | true               | +0/-101        |
+---------------------+--------------------+----------------+
Time Cost: 16.75370462s
Average Speed: 113.277149MB/s
```

- TABLE: The corresponding database and table names

- STRUCTURE EQUALITY: Checks whether the table structure is the same

- DATA DIFF ROWS: `rowAdd` / `rowDelete`. Indicates the number of rows that need to be added/deleted to fix the table

### SQL statements to fix inconsistent data

If different rows exist during the data checking process, the SQL statements will be generated to fix them. If the data inconsistency exists in a chunk, a SQL file named by `chunk.Index` will be generated. The SQL file is located at `${output}/fix-on-${instance}`, and `${instance}` is the value of `task.target-instance` in the `config.toml` file.

A SQL file contains the tale to which the chunk belong and the range information. For the SQL files, you should consider the following three situations:

- If the rows in the downstream database are missing, REPLACE statements will be applied
- If the rows in the downstream database are redundant, DELETE statements will be applied
- If some data of the rows in the downstream database is inconsistent, REPLACE statements will be applied and inconsistent columns will be marked with annotation in the SQL file

```

## Note

- sync-diff-inspector consumes a certain amount of server resources when checking data. Avoid using sync-diff-inspector to check data during peak business hours.
- Before comparing the data in MySQL with that in TiDB, pay attention to the collation configuration of the tables. If the primary key or unique key is the `varchar` type and the collation configuration in MySQL differs from that in TiDB, the final check result might be incorrect because of the collation issue. You need to add collation to the sync-diff-inspector configuration file.
- sync-diff-inspector divides data into chunks first according to TiDB statistics and you need to guarantee the accuracy of the statistics. You can manually run the `analyze table {table_name}` command when the TiDB server's *workload is light*.
- Pay special attention to `table-rules`. If you configure `schema-pattern="test1"`, `table-pattern = "t_1"`, `target-schema="test2"` and `target-table = "t_2"`, the `test1`.`t_1` schema in the source database and the `test2`.`t_2` schema in the target database are compared. Sharding is enabled by default in sync-diff-inspector, so if the source database has a `test2`.`t_2` table,  the `test1`.`t_1` table and `test2`.`t_2` table in the source database serving as sharding are compared with the `test2`.`t_2` table in the target database.
- The generated SQL file is only used as a reference for repairing data, and you need to confirm it before executing these SQL statements to repair data.
