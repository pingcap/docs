# mydumper Instructions

## What is mydumper?

`mydumper` is a fork of the [mydumper](https://github.com/maxbube/mydumper) project with additional functionality specific to TiDB. It is the recommended method to use for logical backups of TiDB.

[Download the Binary](http://download.pingcap.org/tidb-enterprise-tools-latest-linux-amd64.tar.gz).

## What enhancements does this contain over regular mydumper?

+ Uses `tidb_snapshot` to provide backup consistency instead of `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`

+ Includes the hidden `_tidb_rowid` column in `INSERT` statements when present

+ Allows `tidb_snapshot` to be [configurable](../op-guide/history-read.md#how-tidb-reads-data-from-history-versions) (i.e. backup data as it appeared at an earlier point in time)

### New parameter description

```
  -z, --tidb-snapshot: Set the tidb_snapshot to be used for the backup.
                       Default: NOW()-INTERVAL 1 SECOND.
                       Accepts either a TSO or valid datetime.  For example: -z "2016-10-08 16:45:26"
```

### Usage example

Command line parameter:

```
./bin/mydumper -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -P 4000
```
