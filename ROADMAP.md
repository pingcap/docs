# TiDB Roadmap

This document defines the roadmap for TiDB development.

## TiDB:

+ [ ] Optimizer
    - [x] Refactor Ranger
    - [ ] Optimize the cost model
    - [ ] Join Reorder
+ [ ] Statistics
    - [x] Update statistics dynamically according to the query feedback
    - [x] Analyze table automatically
    - [ ] Improve the accuracy of Row Count estimation
+ [ ] Executor
    - [ ] Push down the Projection operator to the Coprocessor
    - [ ] Improve the performance of the HashJoin operator
    - [ ] Parallel Operators
        - [x] Projection
        - [ ] Aggregation
        - [ ] Sort
    - [x] Compact Row Format to reduce memory usage
    - [ ] File Sort
- [ ] View
- [ ] Window Function
- [ ] Common Table Expression
- [ ] Table Partition
- [ ] Cluster Index
- [ ] Improve DDL
  - [x] Speed up Add Index operation
