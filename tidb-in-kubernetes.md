# Deploy a TiDB Cluster in Kubernetes

You can use [TiDB Operator](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator) to deploy TiDB clusters in Kubernetes. TiDB Operator is an automatic operation system for TiDB clusters in Kubernetes. It provides full life-cycle management for TiDB including deployment, upgrades, scaling, backup, fail-over, and configuration changes. With TiDB Operator, TiDB can run seamlessly in the Kubernetes clusters deployed on a public or private cloud.

Currently, the TiDB in Kubernetes documentation is independent of the TiDB documentation. For detailed steps on how to deploy TiDB clusters in Kubernetes using TiDB Operator, see [TiDB in Kubernetes documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/).
