# Deploy a TiDB Cluster on Kubernetes

You can use [TiDB Operator](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator) to deploy TiDB clusters on Kubernetes. TiDB Operator is an automatic operation system for TiDB clusters on Kubernetes. It provides full life-cycle management for TiDB including deployment, upgrades, scaling, backup, fail-over, and configuration changes. With TiDB Operator, TiDB can run seamlessly in the Kubernetes clusters deployed on a public or private cloud.

Currently, the TiDB on Kubernetes documentation is independent of the TiDB documentation. For detailed steps on how to deploy TiDB clusters on Kubernetes using TiDB Operator, learn the [relationship between TiDB Operator and TiDB versions](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/tidb-operator-overview), and see the corresponding [TiDB on Kubernetes documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/).
