# Deploy a TiDB Cluster in Kubernetes

You can use [TiDB Operator](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator) to deploy TiDB clusters in Kubernetes. TiDB Operator is an automatic operation system for TiDB clusters in Kubernetes. It provides a full management life-cycle for TiDB including deployment, upgrades, scaling, backup, fail-over, and configuration changes. With TiDB Operator, TiDB can run seamlessly in the Kubernetes clusters deployed on a public or private cloud.

For the current TiDB release, the available versions of TiDB Operator include v1.0, v1.1, and v1.2. It is recommended to use v1.2, which is the latest stable version of TiDB Operator.

Currently, the TiDB Operator documentation is independent of the TiDB documentation. For detailed steps on how to deploy TiDB clusters in Kubernetes using TiDB Operator, see the corresponding TiDB Operator documentation in the following links:
