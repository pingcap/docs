# Statement Summary Tables

To better handle SQL performance issues, MySQL has provided [statement summary tables](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.html) in `performance_schema` to monitor SQL with statistics. Among these tables, `events_statements_summary_by_digest` is very useful in locating SQL problems with its abundant fields such as latency, execution times, rows scanned, and full table scans.

Therefore, starting from v4.0.0-rc.1, TiDB provides system tables in `information_schema` (_not_ `performance_schema`) that are similar to `events_statements_summary_by_digest` in terms of features.

- [`statements_summary`](#statements_summary)
- [`statements_summary_history`](#statements_summary_history)
- [`cluster_statements_summary`](#statements_summary_evicted)
- [`cluster_statements_summary_history`](#statements_summary_evicted)
- [`statements_summary_evicted`](#statements_summary_evicted)

> **Note:**
>
> The preceding tables are not available on [TiDB Serverless](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/select-cluster-tier#tidb-serverless) clusters.

This document details these tables and introduces how to use them to troubleshoot SQL performance issues.

## `statements_summary`

`statements_summary` is a system table in `information_schema`. `statements_summary` groups the SQL statements by the resource group, the SQL digest and the plan digest, and provides statistics for each SQL category.

The "SQL digest" here means the same as used in slow logs, which is a unique identifier calculated through normalized SQL statements. The normalization process ignores constant, blank characters, and is case insensitive. Therefore, statements with consistent syntaxes have the same digest. For example:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3) AND salary BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000;
select * from EMPLOYEE where ID in (4, 5) and SALARY between 3000 and 4000;
```

After normalization, they are both of the following category:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
select * from employee where id in (...) and salary between ? and ?;
```

The "plan digest" here refers to the unique identifier calculated through normalized execution plan. The normalization process ignores constants. The same SQL statements might be grouped into different categories because the same statements might have different execution plans. SQL statements of the same category have the same execution plan.

`statements_summary` stores the aggregated results of SQL monitoring metrics. In general, each of the monitoring metrics includes the maximum value and average value. For example, the execution latency metric corresponds to two fields: `AVG_LATENCY` (average latency) and `MAX_LATENCY` (maximum latency).

To make sure that the monitoring metrics are up to date, data in the `statements_summary` table is periodically cleared, and only recent aggregated results are retained and displayed. The periodical data clearing is controlled by the `tidb_stmt_summary_refresh_interval` system variable. If you happen to make a query right after the clearing, the data displayed might be very little.

The following is a sample output of querying `statements_summary`:

```
   SUMMARY_BEGIN_TIME: 2020-01-02 11:00:00
     SUMMARY_END_TIME: 2020-01-02 11:30:00

```

> **Note:**
>
> - In TiDB, the time unit of fields in statement summary tables is nanosecond (ns), whereas in MySQL the time unit is picosecond (ps).
> - Starting from v7.5.1 and v7.6.0, for clusters with [resource control](/tidb-resource-control.md) enabled, `statements_summary` will be aggregated by resource group, for example, the same statements executed in different resource groups will be collected as different records.

## `statements_summary_history`

The table schema of `statements_summary_history` is identical to that of `statements_summary`. `statements_summary_history` saves the history data of a time range. By checking history data, you can troubleshoot anomalies and compare monitoring metrics of different time ranges.

The fields `SUMMARY_BEGIN_TIME` and `SUMMARY_END_TIME` represent the start time and the end time of the historical time range.

## `statements_summary_evicted`

The `tidb_stmt_summary_max_stmt_count` variable controls the maximum number of statements that the `statement_summary` table stores in memory. The `statement_summary` table uses the LRU algorithm. Once the number of SQL statements exceeds the `tidb_stmt_summary_max_stmt_count` value, the longest unused record is evicted from the table. The number of evicted SQL statements during each period is recorded in the `statements_summary_evicted` table.

The `statements_summary_evicted` table is updated only when a SQL record is evicted from the `statement_summary` table. The `statements_summary_evicted` only records the period during which the eviction occurs and the number of evicted SQL statements.

## The `cluster` tables for statement summary

The `statements_summary`, `statements_summary_history`, and `statements_summary_evicted` tables only show the statement summary of a single TiDB server. To query the data of the entire cluster, you need to query the `cluster_statements_summary`, `cluster_statements_summary_history`, or `cluster_statements_summary_evicted` tables.

`cluster_statements_summary` displays the `statements_summary` data of each TiDB server. `cluster_statements_summary_history` displays the `statements_summary_history` data of each TiDB server. `cluster_statements_summary_evicted` displays the `statements_summary_evicted` data of each TiDB server. These tables use the `INSTANCE` field to represent the address of the TiDB server. The other fields are the same as those in `statements_summary`, `statements_summary_history`, and `statements_summary_evicted`.

## Parameter configuration

The following system variables are used to control the statement summary:

- `tidb_enable_stmt_summary`: Determines whether to enable the statement summary feature. `1` represents `enable`, and `0` means `disable`. The feature is enabled by default. The statistics in the system table are cleared if this feature is disabled. The statistics are re-calculated next time this feature is enabled. Tests have shown that enabling this feature has little impact on performance.
- `tidb_stmt_summary_refresh_interval`: The interval at which the `statements_summary` table is refreshed. The time unit is second (s). The default value is `1800`.
- `tidb_stmt_summary_history_size`: The size of each SQL statement category stored in the `statements_summary_history` table, which is also the maximum number of records in the `statements_summary_evicted` table. The default value is `24`.

<CustomContent platform="tidb">

- `tidb_stmt_summary_max_stmt_count`: Limits the number of SQL statements that can be stored in statement summary tables. The default value is `3000`. If the limit is exceeded, TiDB clears the SQL statements that recently remain unused. These cleared SQL statements are represented as rows with `DIGEST` set to `NULL` and recorded in the `statements_summary_evicted` table. On the [SQL statements page of TiDB Dashboard](/dashboard/dashboard-statement-list.md#others), the information of these rows is displayed as `Others`.

</CustomContent>

<CustomContent platform="tidb-cloud">

- `tidb_stmt_summary_max_stmt_count`: Limits the number of SQL statements that can be stored in statement summary tables. The default value is `3000`. If the limit is exceeded, TiDB clears the SQL statements that recently remain unused. These cleared SQL statements are represented as rows with `DIGEST` set to `NULL` and recorded in the `statements_summary_evicted` table. On the [SQL statements page of TiDB Dashboard](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/dashboard-statement-list#others), the information of these rows is displayed as `Others`.

</CustomContent>

- `tidb_stmt_summary_max_sql_length`: Specifies the longest display length of `DIGEST_TEXT` and `QUERY_SAMPLE_TEXT`. The default value is `4096`.
- `tidb_stmt_summary_internal_query`: Determines whether to count the TiDB SQL statements. `1` means to count, and `0` means not to count. The default value is `0`.

> **Note:**
>
> When a category of SQL statement needs to be removed because the `tidb_stmt_summary_max_stmt_count` limit is exceeded, TiDB removes the data of that SQL statement category of all time ranges from the `statement_summary_history` table. Therefore, even if the number of SQL statement categories in a certain time range does not reach the limit, the number of SQL statements stored in the `statement_summary_history` table is less than the actual number of SQL statements. If this situation occurs and affects performance, you are recommended to increase the value of `tidb_stmt_summary_max_stmt_count`.

An example of the statement summary configuration is shown as follows:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
set global tidb_stmt_summary_max_stmt_count = 3000;
set global tidb_enable_stmt_summary = true;
set global tidb_stmt_summary_refresh_interval = 1800;
set global tidb_stmt_summary_history_size = 24;
```

After the preceding configuration takes effect, the `statements_summary` table is cleared every 30 minutes and the `statements_summary_history` table stores up to 3000 types of SQL statements. For each type, the `statements_summary_history` table stores data for the recent 24 periods. The `statements_summary_evicted` table records the recent 24 periods during which SQL statements are evicted from the statement summary. The `statements_summary_evicted` table is updated every 30 minutes.

> **Note:**
>
> - If a SQL type appears every minute, the `statements_summary_history` stores data for the most recent 12 hours. If a SQL type only appears from 00:00 to 00:30 every day, the `statements_summary_history` stores data for the most recent 24 periods, with each period being 1 day. Therefore, the `statements_summary_history` stores the most recent 24 days of data for this SQL type.
> - The `tidb_stmt_summary_history_size`, `tidb_stmt_summary_max_stmt_count`, and `tidb_stmt_summary_max_sql_length` configuration items affect memory usage. It is recommended that you adjust these configurations based on your needs, the SQL size, SQL count, and machine configuration. It is not recommended to set them too large values. You can calculate the memory usage using `tidb_stmt_summary_history_size` \* `tidb_stmt_summary_max_stmt_count` \* `tidb_stmt_summary_max_sql_length` \* `3`.

### Set a proper size for statement summary

After the system has run for a period of time (depending on the system load), you can check the `statement_summary` table to see whether SQL eviction has occurred. For example:

```sql
select @@global.tidb_stmt_summary_max_stmt_count;
select count(*) from information_schema.statements_summary;
```

```sql
+-------------------------------------------+
| @@global.tidb_stmt_summary_max_stmt_count |
+-------------------------------------------+
| 3000                                      |
+-------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)

+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|     3001 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

You can see that the `statements_summary` table is full of records. Then check the evicted data from the `statements_summary_evicted` table:

```sql
select * from information_schema.statements_summary_evicted;
```

```sql
+---------------------+---------------------+---------------+
| BEGIN_TIME          | END_TIME            | EVICTED_COUNT |
+---------------------+---------------------+---------------+
| 2020-01-02 16:30:00 | 2020-01-02 17:00:00 |            59 |
+---------------------+---------------------+---------------+
| 2020-01-02 16:00:00 | 2020-01-02 16:30:00 |            45 |
+---------------------+---------------------+---------------+
2 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

From the preceding result, you can see that a maximum of 59 SQL categories are evicted. In this case, it is recommended that you increase the size of the `statement_summary` table by at least 59 records, which means increasing the size to at least 3059 records.

## Limitation

By default, statements summary tables are saved in memory. When a TiDB server restarts, all data will be lost.

<CustomContent platform="tidb">

To address this issue, TiDB v6.6.0 experimentally introduces the [statement summary persistence](#persist-statements-summary) feature, which is disabled by default. After this feature is enabled, the history data is no longer saved in memory, but directly written to disks. In this way, the history data is still available if a TiDB server restarts.

</CustomContent>

## Persist statements summary

<CustomContent platform="tidb-cloud">

This section is only applicable to TiDB Self-Hosted. For TiDB Cloud, the value of the `tidb_stmt_summary_enable_persistent` parameter is `false` by default and does not support dynamic modification.

</CustomContent>

> **Warning:**
>
> Statements summary persistence is an experimental feature. It is not recommended that you use it in the production environment. This feature might be changed or removed without prior notice. If you find a bug, you can report an [issue](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues) on GitHub.

<CustomContent platform="tidb">

As described in the [Limitation](#limitation) section, statements summary tables are saved in memory by default. Once a TiDB server restarts, all the statements summary will be lost. Starting from v6.6.0, TiDB experimentally provides the configuration item [`tidb_stmt_summary_enable_persistent`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#tidb_stmt_summary_enable_persistent-new-in-v660) to allow users to enable or disable statements summary persistence.

</CustomContent>

<CustomContent platform="tidb-cloud">

As described in the [Limitation](#limitation) section, statements summary tables are saved in memory by default. Once a TiDB server restarts, all the statements summary will be lost. Starting from v6.6.0, TiDB experimentally provides the configuration item `tidb_stmt_summary_enable_persistent` to allow users to enable or disable statements summary persistence.

</CustomContent>

To enable statements summary persistence, you can add the following configuration items to the TiDB configuration file:

```toml
[instance]
tidb_stmt_summary_enable_persistent = true
# The following entries use the default values, which can be modified as needed.
# tidb_stmt_summary_filename = "tidb-statements.log"
# tidb_stmt_summary_file_max_days = 3
# tidb_stmt_summary_file_max_size = 64 # MiB
# tidb_stmt_summary_file_max_backups = 0
```

After statements summary persistence is enabled, the memory keeps only the current real-time data and no history data. Once the real-time data is refreshed as history data, the history data is written to the disk at an interval of `tidb_stmt_summary_refresh_interval` described in the [Parameter configuration](#parameter-configuration) section. Queries on the `statements_summary_history` or `cluster_statements_summary_history` table will return results combining both in-memory and on-disk data.

<CustomContent platform="tidb">

> **Note:**
>
> - When statements summary persistence is enabled, the `tidb_stmt_summary_history_size` configuration described in the [Parameter configuration](#parameter-configuration) section will no longer take effect because the memory does not keep the history data. Instead, the following three configurations will be used to control the retention period and size of history data for persistence: [`tidb_stmt_summary_file_max_days`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#tidb_stmt_summary_file_max_days-new-in-v660), [`tidb_stmt_summary_file_max_size`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#tidb_stmt_summary_file_max_size-new-in-v660), and [`tidb_stmt_summary_file_max_backups`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#tidb_stmt_summary_file_max_backups-new-in-v660).
> - The smaller the value of `tidb_stmt_summary_refresh_interval`, the more immediate data is written to the disk. However, this also means more redundant data is written to the disk.

</CustomContent>

## Troubleshooting examples

This section provides two examples to show how to use the statement summary feature to troubleshoot SQL performance issues.

### Could high SQL latency be caused by the server end?

In this example, the client shows slow performance with point queries on the `employee` table. You can perform a fuzzy search on SQL texts:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SELECT avg_latency, exec_count, query_sample_text
    FROM information_schema.statements_summary
    WHERE digest_text LIKE 'select * from employee%';
```

 `1ms` and `0.3ms` are considered within the normal range of `avg_latency`. Therefore, it can be concluded that the server end is not the cause. You can troubleshoot with the client or the network.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
+-------------+------------+------------------------------------------+
| avg_latency | exec_count | query_sample_text                        |
+-------------+------------+------------------------------------------+
|     1042040 |          2 | select * from employee where name='eric' |
|      345053 |          3 | select * from employee where id=3100     |
+-------------+------------+------------------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

### Which categories of SQL statements consume the longest total time?

If the QPS decrease significantly from 10:00 to 10:30, you can find out the three categories of SQL statements with the longest time consumption from the history table:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
SELECT sum_latency, avg_latency, exec_count, query_sample_text
    FROM information_schema.statements_summary_history
    WHERE summary_begin_time='2020-01-02 10:00:00'
    ORDER BY sum_latency DESC LIMIT 3;
```

The result shows that the following three categories of SQL statements consume the longest time in total, which need to be optimized with high priority.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| sum_latency | avg_latency | exec_count | query_sample_text                                                     |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|     7855660 |     1122237 |          7 | select avg(salary) from employee where company_id=2013                |
|     7241960 |     1448392 |          5 | select * from employee join company on employee.company_id=company.id |
|     2084081 |     1042040 |          2 | select * from employee where name='eric'                              |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

- `AVG_AFFECTED_ROWS`: The average number of rows affected.
- `PREV_SAMPLE_TEXT`: When the current SQL statement is `COMMIT`, `PREV_SAMPLE_TEXT` is the previous statement to `COMMIT`. In this case, SQL statements are grouped by the digest and `prev_sample_text`. This means that `COMMIT` statements with different `prev_sample_text` are grouped to different rows.
