# Export or Backup Data Using Dumpling

This document introduces how to use the [Dumpling](https://github.com/pingcap/dumpling) tool to export or backup data in TiDB. Dumpling exports data stored in TiDB as SQL or CSV data files and can be used to make a logical full backup or export.

For backups of SST files (KV pairs) or backups of incremental data that are not sensitive to latency, refer to [BR](/br/backup-and-restore-tool.md). For real-time backups of incremental data, refer to [TiCDC](/ticdc/ticdc-overview.md).

For detailed usage of Dumpling, use the `--help` command or refer to [Dumpling User Guide](https://github.com/pingcap/dumpling/blob/master/docs/en/user-guide.md).

When using Dumpling, you need to execute the export command on a running cluster. This document assumes that there is a TiDB instance on the `127.0.0.1:4000` host and that this TiDB instance has a root user without a password.

## Export data from TiDB

### Export to SQL files

Dumpling exports data to SQL files by default. You can also export data to SQL files by adding the `--filetype sql` flag:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
dumpling \
  -u root \
  -P 4000 \
  -h 127.0.0.1 \
  --filetype sql \
  --threads 32 \
  -o /tmp/test \
  -F 256
```

In the above command, `-h`, `-P` and `-u` mean address, port and user, respectively. If password authentication is required, you can pass it to Dumpling with `-p $YOUR_SECRET_PASSWORD`.

### Export to CSV files

If Dumpling exports data to CSV files (use `--filetype csv` to export to CSV files), you can also use `--sql <SQL>` to export the records selected by the specified SQL statement.

For example, you can export all records that match `id < 100` in `test.sbtest1` using the following command:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
./dumpling \
  -u root \
  -P 4000 \
  -h 127.0.0.1 \
  -o /tmp/test \
  --filetype csv \
  --sql 'select * from `test`.`sbtest1` where id < 100'
```

> **Note:**
>
> - Currently, the `--sql` option can be used only for exporting to CSV files.
>
> - Here you need to execute the `select * from <table-name> where id <100` statement on all tables to be exported. If some tables do not have specified fields, the export fails.

### Filter the exported data

#### Use the `--where` command to filter data

By default, Dumpling exports the tables of the entire database except the tables in the system databases. You can use `--where <SQL where expression>` to select the records to be exported.

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
./dumpling \
  -u root \
  -P 4000 \
  -h 127.0.0.1 \
  -o /tmp/test \
  --where "id < 100"
```

The above command exports the data that matches `id < 100` from each table.

#### Use the `--filter` command to filter data

Dumpling can filter specific databases or tables by specifying the table filter with the `--filter` command. The syntax of table filters is similar to that of `.gitignore`. For details, see [Table Filter](/table-filter.md).

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
./dumpling \
  -u root \
  -P 4000 \
  -h 127.0.0.1 \
  -o /tmp/test \
  --filter "employees.*" \
  --filter "*.WorkOrder"
```

The above command exports all the tables in the `employees` database and the `WorkOrder` tables in all databases.

#### Use the `-B` or `-T` command to filter data

Dumpling can also export specific databases with the `-B` command or specific tables with the `-T` command.

> **Note:**
> 
> - The `--filter` command and the `-T` command cannot be used at the same time.
>
> - The `-T` command can only accept a complete form of inputs like `database-name.table-name`, and inputs with only the table name are not accepted. Example: Dumpling cannot recognize `-T WorkOrder`.

Examples:

-`-B employees` exports the `employees` database
-`-T employees.WorkOrder` exports the `employees.WorkOrder` table

### Improve export efficiency through concurrency

The exported file is stored in the `./export-<current local time>` directory by default. Commonly used parameters are as follows:

- `-o` is used to select the directory where the exported files are stored.
- `-F` option is used to specify the maximum size of a single file (the unit here is `MiB`; inputs like `5GiB` or `8KB` are also acceptable).
- `-r` option is used to specify the maximum number of records (or the number of rows in the database) for a single file. When it is enabled, Dumpling enables concurrency in the table to improve the speed of exporting large tables.

You can use the above parameters to provide Dumpling with a higher degree of concurrency.

### Adjust Dumpling's data consistency options

> **Note:**
>
> In most scenarios, you do not need to adjust the default data consistency options of Dumpling.

Dumpling uses the `--consistency <consistency level>` option to control the way in which data is exported for "consistency assurance". For TiDB, data consistency is guaranteed by getting a snapshot of a certain timestamp by default (i.e. `--consistency snapshot`). When using snapshot for consistency, you can use the `--snapshot` parameter to specify the timestamp to be backed up. You can also use the following levels of consistency:

- `flush`: Use [`FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/flush.html#flush-tables-with-read-lock) to ensure consistency.
- `snapshot`: Get a consistent snapshot of the specified timestamp and export it.
- `lock`: Add read locks on all tables to be exported.
- `none`: No guarantee for consistency.
- `auto`: Use `flush` for MySQL and `snapshot` for TiDB.

After everything is done, you can see the exported file in `/tmp/test`:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
ls -lh /tmp/test | awk '{print $5 "\t" $9}'
```

```
140B  metadata
66B   test-schema-create.sql
300B  test.sbtest1-schema.sql
190K  test.sbtest1.0.sql
300B  test.sbtest2-schema.sql
190K  test.sbtest2.0.sql
300B  test.sbtest3-schema.sql
190K  test.sbtest3.0.sql
```

In addition, if the data volume is very large, to avoid export failure due to GC during the export process, you can extend the GC time in advance:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
update mysql.tidb set VARIABLE_VALUE = '720h' where VARIABLE_NAME = 'tikv_gc_life_time';
```

After your operation is completed, set the GC time back (the default value is `10m`):

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
update mysql.tidb set VARIABLE_VALUE = '10m' where VARIABLE_NAME = 'tikv_gc_life_time';
```

Finally, all the exported data can be imported back to TiDB using [Lightning](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-tidb-backend.md).
