## Contribute to TiDB

We recommend starting with an existing issue with the [help-wanted](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) label. These issues are well suited for new contributors.

If a PR (Pull Request) submitted to the [TiDB/TiKV/TiSpark/PD/TiDB Operator/Docs/Docs-cn](https://github.com/pingcap) projects by you is approved and merged, then you become a TiDB Contributor.

Before submitting a pull request, sign the [CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/pingcap/tidb?pullRequest=5567).

If you want to work on a new idea of relatively small scope:

1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the repo in question.
2. The repo owners will respond to your issue promptly.
3. If your proposed change is accepted, sign the [CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/pingcap/tidb?pullRequest=5567), and start work in your fork.
4. Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/3113) containing a tested change.

Contributions are welcomed and greatly appreciated. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on submitting patches and the contribution workflow.
