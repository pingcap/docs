# COMMIT

This statement commits a transaction inside of the TIDB server.

In the absence of a `BEGIN` or `START TRANSACTION` statement, the default behavior of TiDB is that every statement will be its own transaction and autocommit. This behavior ensures MySQL compatibility.

## Synopsis

**CommitStmt:**

## Examples

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (a int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)

mysql> START TRANSACTION;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> COMMIT;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

## MySQL compatibility

* In MySQL, with the exception of Group Replication with multiple primaries, it is not typical that a `COMMIT` statement could result in an error. By contrast, TiDB uses optimistic concurrency control and conflicts may result in `COMMIT` returning an error.
* Be default, `UNIQUE` and `PRIMARY KEY` constraint checks are deffered until statement commit. This behavior can be changed by setting `tidb_constraint_check_in_place=TRUE`.
