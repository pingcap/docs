# CREATE USER

This statement creates a new user, specified with a password. In the MySQL privilege system, a user is the combination of a username and the host from which they are connecting from. Thus, it is possible to create a user `'newuser2'@'192.168.1.1'` who is only able to connect from the IP address `192.168.1.1`. It is also possible to have two users have the same user-portion, and different permissions as they login from different hosts.

## MySQL compatibility

* Several of the `CREATE` options are not yet supported by TiDB, and will be parsed but ignored.
