TiDB version: 3.0.6

TiDB Ansible version: 3.0.6

## TiDB

+ SQL Optimizer
    - Fix the issue that the result is incorrect after the window function AST restores SQL text, for example, `over w` being mistakenly restored to `over (w)` [#12933](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12933)
    - Fix the issue of pushing down `STREAM AGG()` to `doubleRead` [#12690](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12690)
    - Fix the issue that quotes are incorrectly handled for SQL binding [#13117](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13117)

## Tools

+ TiDB Binlog
    - Obtain the initial replication timestamp from PD when `initial-commit-ts` is set to “-1” in Drainer [#788](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-binlog/pull/788)
    - Decouple Drainer’s `Checkpoint` storage from the downstream and support saving `Checkpoint` in  MySQL or local files [#790](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-binlog/pull/790)
    - Fix the Drainer panic issue caused by using empty values when configuring replication database/table filtering [#801](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-binlog/pull/801)
    - Fix the issue that processes get into the deadlock status instead of exiting after a panic occurs because Drainer fails to apply binlog files to the downstream [#807](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-binlog/pull/807)
    - Fix the issue that Pump blocks when it exits because of gRPC’s `GracefulStop` [#817](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-binlog/pull/817)
    - Fix the issue that Drainer fails when it receives a binlog which misses a column during the execution of a `DROP COLUMN` statement in TiDB (v3.0.6 or later) [#827](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-binlog/pull/827)
+ TiDB Lightning
    - Add the `max-allowed-packet` configuration (64 M by default) for the TiDB backend [#248](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-lightning/pull/248)
