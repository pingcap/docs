# TiDB Cluster Configurations in Kubernetes

This document introduces the following items of a TiDB cluster in Kubernetes:

+ The configuration parameters
+ The configuration of resources
+ The configuration of disaster recovery

## Configuration parameters

TiDB Operator uses `Helm` to deploy and manage TiDB clusters. The configuration file obtained through Helm provides the basic configuration by default with which you could quickly start a TiDB cluster. However, if you want special configurations or are deploying in a production environment, you need to manually configure the corresponding parameters according to the table below.

> **Note:**
>
> In the following table, `values.yaml` refers to the TiDB cluster's configuration file to be modified.

| Parameter | Description | Default Value |
| :----- | :---- | :----- |
| `rbac.create` | Whether to enable the RBAC mode of Kubernetes | `true` |
| `clusterName` |The TiDB cluster name. This variable is unset by default. In this case, `tidb-cluster` directly replaces it with `ReleaseName` when the cluster is being installed. | `nil` |
| `extraLabels` | Adds extra labels to the `TidbCluster` object (CRD). See [labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) | `{}` |
| `schedulerName` | The scheduler used by the TiDB cluster | `tidb-scheduler` |
| `timezone` | The default timezone used by the TiDB cluster | `UTC` |
| `pvReclaimPolicy` | The reclaim policy for PV (Persistent Volume) used by the TiDB cluster | `Retain` |
| `services[0].name` | The name of the service that the TiDB cluster exposes | `nil` |
| `services[0].type` | The type of the service that the TiDB cluster exposes (selected from `ClusterIP`, `NodePort` and `LoadBalancer`) | `nil` |

| `tidb.txnLocalLatchesEnabled` | Whether to enable the memory lock for transactions. It is recommended to enable the lock when there are many local transaction conflicts.<br>If the version of TiDB Operator is later than v1.0.0, configure this parameter via `tidb.config`:<br>`[txn-local-latches]`<br>`enabled = false` | `false` |
| `tidb.txnLocalLatchesCapacity` |  The capacity of the transaction memory lock. The number of slots corresponding to Hash is automatically adjusted upward to an exponential multiple of `2`. Each slot occupies 32 Bytes of memory. When the range of writing data is relatively wide (such as importing data), setting this parameter too small a value results in lower performance.<br>If the version of TiDB Operator is later than v1.0.0, configure this parameter via `tidb.config`:<br>`[txn-local-latches]`<br>`capacity = 10240000` | `10240000` |

| `tidb.treatOldVersionUtf8AsUtf8mb4` | This parameter is used for upgrading compatibility. When it is set to `true`, `utf8` character set in the old table/column is treated as `utf8mb4`.<br>If the version of TiDB Operator is later than v1.0.0, configure this parameter via `tidb.config`:<br>`treat-old-version-utf8-as-utf8mb4 = true` | `true` |
| `tidb.lease` | The lease time of TiDB Schema lease. It is highly risky to change this parameter.

| `tidb.maxProcs` | The maximum available CPU cores. `0` represents the number of CPU on the machine or Pod.<br>If the version of TiDB Operator is later than v1.0.0, configure this parameter via `tidb.config`:<br>`[performance]`<br>`max-procs = 0` | `0` |

## Resource configuration

Before deploying a TiDB cluster, it is necessary to configure the resources for each component of the cluster depending on your needs. PD, TiKV and TiDB are the core service components of a TiDB cluster. In a production environment, their resource configurations must be specified according to component needs. Detailed reference: [Hardware Recommendations](/v3.0/how-to/deploy/hardware-recommendations.md).

To ensure the proper scheduling and stable operation of the components of the TiDB cluster in Kubernetes, it is recommended to set Guaranteed-level QoS by letting `limits` equal to `requests` when configuring resources. Detailed reference: [Configure Quality of Service for Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/).

If you are using a NUMA-based CPU, you need to enable `Static`'s CPU management policy on the node for better performance. In order to allow the TiDB cluster component to monopolize the corresponding CPU resources, the CPU quota must be an integer greater than or equal to `1` besides setting Guaranteed-level QoS as mentioned above. Detailed reference: [Control CPU Management Policies on the Node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cpu-management-policies).

## Disaster recovery configuration

TiDB is a distributed database and its disaster recovery must ensure that when any physical topology node fails, not only the service is unaffected, but also the data is complete and available. The two configurations of disaster recovery are described separately as follows.

### Disaster recovery of TiDB service

The disaster recovery of TiDB service is essentially based on Kubernetes' scheduling capabilities. To optimize scheduling, TiDB Operator provides a custom scheduler that guarantees the disaster recovery of TiDB service at the host level through the specified scheduling algorithm. Currently, the TiDB cluster uses this scheduler as the default scheduler, which is configured through the item `schedulerName` in the above table.

Disaster recovery at other levels (such as rack, zone, region) are guaranteed by Affinity's `PodAntiAffinity`. `PodAntiAffinity` can avoid the situation where different instances of the same component are deployed on the same physical topology node. In this way, disaster recovery is achieved. Detailed user guide for Affinity: [Affinity & AntiAffinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-Pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

The following is an example of a typical disaster recovery setup:

{{< copyable "" >}}

```shell
affinity:
 podAntiAffinity:
   preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
   # this term works when the nodes have the label named region
   - weight: 10
     podAffinityTerm:
       labelSelector:
         matchLabels:
           app.kubernetes.io/instance: <release name>
           app.kubernetes.io/component: "pd"
       topologyKey: "region"
       namespaces:
       - <helm namespace>
   # this term works when the nodes have the label named zone
   - weight: 20
     podAffinityTerm:
       labelSelector:
         matchLabels:
           app.kubernetes.io/instance: <release name>
           app.kubernetes.io/component: "pd"
       topologyKey: "zone"
       namespaces:
       - <helm namespace>
   # this term works when the nodes have the label named rack
   - weight: 40
     podAffinityTerm:
       labelSelector:
         matchLabels:
           app.kubernetes.io/instance: <release name>
           app.kubernetes.io/component: "pd"
       topologyKey: "rack"
       namespaces:
       - <helm namespace>
   # this term works when the nodes have the label named kubernetes.io/hostname
   - weight: 80
     podAffinityTerm:
       labelSelector:
         matchLabels:
           app.kubernetes.io/instance: <release name>
           app.kubernetes.io/component: "pd"
       topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
       namespaces:
       - <helm namespace>
```

### Disaster recovery of data

Before configuring the data disaster recovery, read [Information Configuration of the Cluster Typology](/v3.0/how-to/deploy/geographic-redundancy/location-awareness.md) which describes how the disaster recovery of the TiDB cluster is implemented.

To add the data disaster recovery feature in Kubernetes:

1. Set the label collection of topological location for PD

    > **Note:**
    >
    > Except for `kubernetes.io/hostname`, PD currently does not support labels with `/` in the name.

    Replace the `location-labels` information in the `pd.config` with the label collection that describes the topological location on the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster.

2. Set the topological information of the Node where the TiKV node is located.

    TiDB Operator automatically obtains the topological information of the Node for TiKV and calls the PD interface to set this information as the information of TiKV's store labels. Based on this topological information, the TiDB cluster schedules the replicas of the data.

    If the Node of the current Kubernetes cluster does not have a label indicating the topological location, or if the existing label name of topology contains `/`, you can manually add a label to the Node by running the following command:

    {{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

    ```shell
    kubectl label node <nodeName> region=<regionName> zone=<zoneName> rack=<rackName> kubernetes.io/hostname=<hostName>
    ```

    In the command above, `region`, `zone`, `rack`, and `kubernetes.io/hostname` are just examples. The name and number of the label to be added can be arbitrarily defined, as long as it conforms to the specification and is consistent with the labels set by `location-labels` in `pd.config`.
