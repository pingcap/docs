# Local PV Configuration

TiDB is a database with high availability. Data is stored and replicated on TiKV, the storage layer of TiDB, which can tolerate the inavailability of nodes. TiKV uses local storage with high IOPS and high throughput, such as Local SSDs, to enhance database capacity.

Kubernetes currently supports statically allocated local storage. To create a local storage object, use the `local-volume-provisioner` program in [local-static-provisioner](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/sig-storage-local-static-provisioner) project. The procedures are as follows:

1. Pre-allocate local storage in TiKV cluster nodes. See the [operation document](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/sig-storage-local-static-provisioner/blob/master/docs/operations.md) provided by Kubernetes for reference.

2. Install the `local-volume-provisioner` program. See the [Helm installation procedure](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/sig-storage-local-static-provisioner/tree/master/helm) for reference.

For more information, refer to [Kubernetes local storage](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#local) and [local-static-provisioner document](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/sig-storage-local-static-provisioner#overview).

## Data safety

By default, when a local PV is released, the provisioner recycles it. To prevent data from being recycled automatically, you must set the reclaim policy of your storage class to `Retain`. After confirming that a PV's data can be deleted, modify its reclaim policy to `Delete`. For how to change PV reclaim policy in Kubernetes, refer to [this doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/change-pv-reclaim-policy/).

## Best practices

- The path of local PV is the unique identifier of local storage on the node. To avoid conflict, it's recommended to use the UUID of the device to generate a unique path.
- For IO isolation, a whole physical disk per volume is recommended.
- For capacity isolation, a separate partition per volume is recommended.

Refer to [Best Practices](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/sig-storage-local-static-provisioner/blob/master/docs/best-practices.md) for more information with local PV in Kubernetes.
