# PD Control User Guide

As a command line tool of PD, PD Control obtains the state information of the cluster and tunes the cluster.

## Install PD Control

### Use TiUP command

To use PD Control, execute the `tiup ctl pd -u http://<pd_ip>:<pd_port> [-i]` command.

### Download TiDB installation package

If you want to download the latest version of `pd-ctl`, directly download the TiDB package, because `pd-ctl` is included in the TiDB package.

| Package download link | OS | Architecture | SHA256 checksum |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `https://download.pingcap.org/tidb-{version}-linux-amd64.tar.gz` (pd-ctl) | Linux | amd64 | `https://download.pingcap.org/tidb-{version}-linux-amd64.sha256` |

> **Note:**
>
> `{version}` indicates the version number of TiDB. For example, if `{version}` is `v4.0.0-rc.2`, the package download link is `https://download.pingcap.org/tidb-v4.0.0-rc.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz`. You can also download the latest unpublished version by replacing `{version}` with `latest`.

### Compile from source code

1. [Go](https://golang.org/) Version 1.13 or later because the Go modules are used.
2. In the root directory of the [PD project](https://github.com/pingcap/pd), use the `make` or `make pd-ctl` command to compile and generate `bin/pd-ctl`.

## Usage

Single-command mode:

```bash
./pd-ctl store -u http://127.0.0.1:2379
```

Interactive mode:

```bash
./pd-ctl -i -u http://127.0.0.1:2379
```

Use environment variables:

```bash
export PD_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:2379
./pd-ctl
```

Use TLS to encrypt:

```bash
./pd-ctl -u https://127.0.0.1:2379 --cacert="path/to/ca" --cert="path/to/cert" --key="path/to/key"
```

"4.0.0"
```

- `max-snapshot-count` controls the maximum number of snapshots that a single store receives or sends out at the same time. The scheduler is restricted by this configuration to avoid taking up normal application resources. When you need to improve the speed of adding replicas or balancing, increase this value.

    ```bash
    >> config set max-snapshot-count 16  // Set the maximum number of snapshots to 16
    ```

- `max-pending-peer-count` controls the maximum number of pending peers in a single store. The scheduler is restricted by this configuration to avoid producing a large number of Regions without the latest log in some nodes. When you need to improve the speed of adding replicas or balancing, increase this value. Setting it to 0 indicates no limit.

    ```bash
    >> config set max-pending-peer-count 64  // Set the maximum number of pending peers to 64
    ```

- `max-merge-region-size` controls the upper limit on the size of Region Merge (the unit is M). When `regionSize` exceeds the specified value, PD does not merge it with the adjacent Region. Setting it to 0 indicates disabling Region Merge.

    ```bash
    >> config set max-merge-region-size 16 // Set the upper limit on the size of Region Merge to 16M
    ```

- `max-merge-region-keys` controls the upper limit on the key count of Region Merge. When `regionKeyCount` exceeds the specified value, PD does not merge it with the adjacent Region.

    ```bash
    >> config set max-merge-region-keys 50000 // Set the the upper limit on keyCount to 50000
    ```

- `split-merge-interval` controls the interval between the `split` and `merge` operations on a same Region. This means the newly split Region won't be merged within a period of time.

    ```bash
    >> config set split-merge-interval 24h  // Set the interval between `split` and `merge` to one day
    ```

- `enable-one-way-merge` controls whether PD only allows a Region to merge with the next Region. When you set it to `false`, PD allows a Region to merge with the adjacent two Regions.

    ```bash
    >> config set enable-one-way-merge true  // Enables one-way merging.
    ```

- `enable-cross-table-merge` is used to enable the merging of cross-table Regions. When you set it to `false`, PD does not merge the Regions from different tables. This option only works when key type is "table".

    ```bash
    >> config set enable-cross-table-merge true  // Enable cross table merge.
    ```

- `key-type` specifies the key encoding type used for the cluster. The supported options are ["table", "raw", "txn"], and the default value is "table".
    - If no TiDB instance exists in the cluster, `key-type` will be "raw" or "txn", and PD is allowed to merge Regions across tables regardless of the `enable-cross-table-merge` setting.
    - If any TiDB instance exists in the cluster, `key-type` should be "table". Whether PD can merge Regions across tables is determined by `enable-cross-table-merge`. If `key-type` is "raw", placement rules do not work.

    ```bash
    >> config set key-type raw  // Enable cross table merge.
    ```

- `patrol-region-interval` controls the execution frequency that `replicaChecker` checks the health status of Regions. A shorter interval indicates a higher execution frequency. Generally, you do not need to adjust it.

    ```bash
    >> config set patrol-region-interval 10ms // Set the execution frequency of replicaChecker to 10ms
    ```

- `max-store-down-time` controls the time that PD decides the disconnected store cannot be restored if exceeded. If PD does not receive heartbeats from a store within the specified period of time, PD adds replicas in other nodes.

    ```bash
    >> config set max-store-down-time 30m  // Set the time within which PD receives no heartbeats and after which PD starts to add replicas to 30 minutes
    ```

- `leader-schedule-limit` controls the number of tasks scheduling the leader at the same time. This value affects the speed of leader balance. A larger value means a higher speed and setting the value to 0 closes the scheduling. Usually the leader scheduling has a small load, and you can increase the value in need.

    ```bash
    >> config set leader-schedule-limit 4         // 4 tasks of leader scheduling at the same time at most
    ```

- `region-schedule-limit` controls the number of tasks of scheduling Regions at the same time. This value avoids too many Region balance operators being created. The default value is `2048` which is enough for all sizes of clusters, and setting the value to `0` closes the scheduling. Usually, the Region scheduling speed is limited by `store-limit`, but it is recommended that you do not customize this value unless you know exactly what you are doing.

    ```bash
    >> config set region-schedule-limit 2         // 2 tasks of Region scheduling at the same time at most
    ```

- `replica-schedule-limit` controls the number of tasks scheduling the replica at the same time. This value affects the scheduling speed when the node is down or removed. A larger value means a higher speed and setting the value to 0 closes the scheduling. Usually the replica scheduling has a large load, so do not set a too large value.

    ```bash
    >> config set replica-schedule-limit 4        // 4 tasks of replica scheduling at the same time at most
    ```

- `merge-schedule-limit` controls the number of Region Merge scheduling tasks. Setting the value to 0 closes Region Merge. Usually the Merge scheduling has a large load, so do not set a too large value.

    ```bash
    >> config set merge-schedule-limit 16       // 16 tasks of Merge scheduling at the same time at most
    ```

- `hot-region-schedule-limit` controls the hot Region scheduling tasks that are running at the same time. Setting its value to `0` means to disable the scheduling. It is not recommended to set a too large value, otherwise it might affect the system performance.

    ```bash
    >> config set hot-region-schedule-limit 4       // 4 tasks of hot Region scheduling at the same time at most
    ```

- `hot-region-cache-hits-threshold` is used to set the threshold of a hot Region. A Region is considered as hot only if the number of its cache hits exceeds this threshold.

- `tolerant-size-ratio` controls the size of the balance buffer area. When the score difference between the leader or Region of the two stores is less than specified multiple times of the Region size, it is considered in balance by PD.

    ```bash
    >> config set tolerant-size-ratio 20        // Set the size of the buffer area to about 20 times of the average regionSize
    ```

- `low-space-ratio` controls the threshold value that is considered as insufficient store space. When the ratio of the space occupied by the node exceeds the specified value, PD tries to avoid migrating data to the corresponding node as much as possible. At the same time, PD mainly schedules the remaining space to avoid using up the disk space of the corresponding node.

    ```bash
    config set low-space-ratio 0.9              // Set the threshold value of insufficient space to 0.9
    ```

- `high-space-ratio` controls the threshold value that is considered as sufficient store space. When the ratio of the space occupied by the node is less than the specified value, PD ignores the remaining space and mainly schedules the actual data volume.

    ```bash
    config set high-space-ratio 0.5             // Set the threshold value of sufficient space to 0.5
    ```

- `cluster-version` is the version of the cluster, which is used to enable or disable some features and to deal with the compatibility issues. By default, it is the minimum version of all normally running TiKV nodes in the cluster. You can set it manually only when you need to roll it back to an earlier version.

    ```bash
    config set cluster-version 1.0.8              // Set the version of the cluster to 1.0.8
    ```

- `leader-schedule-policy` is used to select the scheduling strategy for the leader. You can schedule the leader according to `size` or `count`.

- `scheduler-max-waiting-operator` is used to control the number of waiting operators in each scheduler.

- `enable-remove-down-replica` is used to enable the feature of automatically deleting DownReplica. When you set it to `false`, PD does not automatically clean up the downtime replicas.

- `enable-replace-offline-replica` is used to enable the feature of migrating OfflineReplica. When you set it to `false`, PD does not migrate the offline replicas.

- `enable-make-up-replica` is used to enable the feature of making up replicas. When you set it to `false`, PD does not add replicas for Regions without sufficient replicas.

- `enable-remove-extra-replica` is used to enable the feature of removing extra replicas. When you set it to `false`, PD does not remove extra replicas for Regions with redundant replicas.

- `enable-location-replacement` is used to enable the isolation level checking. When you set it to `false`, PD does not increase the isolation level of a Region replica through scheduling.

- `enable-debug-metrics` is used to enable the metrics for debugging. When you set it to `true`, PD enables some metrics such as `balance-tolerant-size`.

- `enable-placement-rules` is used to enable placement rules.

- `store-limit-mode` is used to control the mode of limiting the store speed. The optional modes are `auto` and `manual`. In `auto` mode, the stores are automatically balanced according to the load (experimental).

#### `config placement-rules [disable | enable | load | save | show]`

For the usage of `config placement-rules [disable | enable | load | save | show]`, see [Configure placement rules](/configure-placement-rules.md#configure-rules).

### `health`

Use this command to view the health information of the cluster.

### `hot [read | write | store]`

Use this command to view the hot spot information of the cluster.

Usage:

```bash
>> hot read                             // Display hot spot for the read operation
>> hot write                            // Display hot spot for the write operation

```

### `member [delete | leader_priority | leader [show | resign | transfer <member_name>]]`

Use this command to view the PD members, remove a specified member, or configure the priority of leader.

Usage:

```bash
>> member                               // Display the information of all members
{
  "header": {......},
  "members": [......],
  "leader": {......},
  "etcd_leader": {......},
}
>> member delete name pd2               // Delete "pd2"
Success!
>> member delete id 1319539429105371180 // Delete a node using id
Success!
>> member leader show                   // Display the leader information
{
  "name": "pd",
  "member_id": 13155432540099656863,
  "peer_urls": [......],
  "client_urls": [......]
}
>> member leader resign // Move leader away from the current member
......
>> member leader transfer pd3 // Migrate leader to a specified member
......
```

### `operator [check | show | add | remove]`

Use this command to view and control the scheduling operation.

Usage:

```bash
>> operator show                                        // Display all operators
>> operator show admin                                  // Display all admin operators

>> operator show region                                 // Display all Region operators
>> operator add add-peer 1 2                            // Add a replica of Region 1 on store 2
>> operator add add-learner 1 2                         // Add a learner replica of Region 1 on store 2
>> operator add remove-peer 1 2                         // Remove a replica of Region 1 on store 2
>> operator add transfer-leader 1 2                     // Schedule the leader of Region 1 to store 2
>> operator add transfer-region 1 2 3 4                 // Schedule Region 1 to stores 2,3,4
>> operator add transfer-peer 1 2 3                     // Schedule the replica of Region 1 on store 2 to store 3
>> operator add merge-region 1 2                        // Merge Region 1 with Region 2
>> operator add split-region 1 --policy=approximate     // Split Region 1 into two Regions in halves, based on approximately estimated value
>> operator add split-region 1 --policy=scan            // Split Region 1 into two Regions in halves, based on accurate scan value
>> operator remove 1                                    // Remove the scheduling operation of Region 1
>> operator check 1                                     // Check the status of the operators related to Region 1
```

The splitting of Regions starts from the position as close as possible to the middle. You can locate this position using two strategies, namely "scan" and "approximate". The difference between them is that the former determines the middle key by scanning the Region, and the latter obtains the approximate position by checking the statistics recorded in the SST file. Generally, the former is more accurate, while the latter consumes less I/O and can be completed faster.

### `ping`

>> scheduler resume all                           // Continue to run all schedulers

```

#### `scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler`

Use this command to view and control the `balance-hot-region-scheduler` policy.

Usage:

```bash
>> scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler  // Display all configuration of the balance-hot-region scheduler
{
  "min-hot-byte-rate": 100,
  "min-hot-key-rate": 10,
  "max-zombie-rounds": 3,
  "max-peer-number": 1000,
  "byte-rate-rank-step-ratio": 0.05,
  "key-rate-rank-step-ratio": 0.05,
  "count-rank-step-ratio": 0.01,
  "great-dec-ratio": 0.95,
  "minor-dec-ratio": 0.99,
  "src-tolerance-ratio": 1.02,
  "dst-tolerance-ratio": 1.02
}
```

- `min-hot-byte-rate` means the smallest byte counted, which is usually 100.

    ```bash
    >> scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler set min-hot-byte-rate 100
    ```

- `min-hot-key-rate` means the smallest key counted, which is usually 10.

    ```bash
    >> scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler set min-hot-key-rate 10
    ```

- `max-zombie-rounds` means the maximum number of heartbeats with which an operator can be considered as the pending influence. If you set it to a larger value, more operators might be included in the pending influence. Usually, you do not need to adjust its value. Pending influence refers to the operator influence that is generated during scheduling but still has an effect.

    ```bash
    >> scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler set max-zombie-rounds 3
    ```

- `max-peer-number` means the maximum number of peers to be solved, which prevents the scheduler from being too slow.

    ```bash
    >> scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler set max-peer-number 1000
    ```

- `byte-rate-rank-step-ratio`, `key-rate-rank-step-ratio`, and `count-rank-step-ratio` respectively mean the step ranks of byte, key, and count. The rank step ratio decides the step when the rank is calculated. `great-dec-ratio` and `minor-dec-ratio` are used to determine the `dec` rank. Usually, you do not need to modify these items.

    ```bash
    >> scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler set byte-rate-rank-step-ratio 0.05
    ```

- `src-tolerance-ratio` and `dst-tolerance-ratio` are configuration items for the expectation scheduler. The smaller the `tolerance-ratio`, the easier it is for scheduling. When redundant scheduling occurs, you can appropriately increase this value.

    ```bash
    >> scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler set src-tolerance-ratio 1.05
    ```

### `store [delete | label | weight | remove-tombstone | limit | limit-scene] <store_id>  [--jq="<query string>"]`

Use this command to view the store information or remove a specified store. For a jq formatted output, see [jq-formatted-json-output-usage](#jq-formatted-json-output-usage).

Usage:

```bash
>> store                               // Display information of all stores
{
  "count": 3,
  "stores": [...]
}
>> store 1                             // Get the store with the store id of 1
  ......
>> store delete 1                      // Delete the store with the store id of 1
  ......
>> store label 1 zone cn               // Set the value of the label with the "zone" key to "cn" for the store with the store id of 1
>> store weight 1 5 10                 // Set the leader weight to 5 and region weight to 10 for the store with the store id of 1
>> store remove-tombstone              // Remove stores that are in tombstone state
>> store limit                         // Show the speed limit of adding-peer operations and the limit of removing-peer operations per minute in all stores
>> store limit add-peer                // Show the speed limit of adding-peer operations per minute in all stores
>> store limit remove-peer             // Show the limit of removing-peer operations per minute in all stores
>> store limit all 5                   // Set the limit of adding-peer operations to 5 and the limit of removing-peer operations to 5 per minute for all stores
>> store limit 1 5                     // Set the limit of adding-peer operations to 5 and the limit of removing-peer operations to 5 per minute for store 1
>> store limit all 5 add-peer          // Set the limit of adding-peer operations to 5 per minute for all stores
>> store limit 1 5 add-peer            // Set the limit of adding-peer operations to 5 per minute for store 1
>> store limit 1 5 remove-peer         // Set the limit of removing-peer operations to 5 per minute for store 1
>> store limit all 5 remove-peer       // Set the limit of removing-peer operations to 5 per minute for all stores
>> store limit-scene                   // Show all limit scenarios (experimental)
{
  "Idle": 100,
  "Low": 50,
  "Normal": 32,
  "High": 12
}
>> store limit-scene idle 100 // set rate to 100 in the idle scene (experimental)
```

> **Note:**
>
> When you use the `store limit` command, the original `region-add` and `region-remove` are deprecated. Use `add-peer` and `remove-peer` instead.

### `log [fatal | error | warn | info | debug]`

Use this command to set the log level of the PD leader.

Usage:

```bash
>> log warn
```

### `tso`

Use this command to parse the physical and logical time of TSO.

Usage:

```bash
>> tso 395181938313123110        // Parse TSO
system:  2017-10-09 05:50:59 +0800 CST
logic:  120102
```

## Jq formatted JSON output usage

### Simplify the output of `store`

```bash
» store --jq=".stores[].store | { id, address, state_name}"
{"id":1,"address":"127.0.0.1:20161","state_name":"Up"}
{"id":30,"address":"127.0.0.1:20162","state_name":"Up"}
...
```

### Query the remaining space of the node

```bash
» store --jq=".stores[] | {id: .store.id, available: .status.available}"
{"id":1,"available":"10 GiB"}
{"id":30,"available":"10 GiB"}
...
```

### Query the distribution status of the Region replicas

```bash
» region --jq=".regions[] | {id: .id, peer_stores: [.peers[].store_id]}"
{"id":2,"peer_stores":[1,30,31]}
{"id":4,"peer_stores":[1,31,34]}
...
```

### Filter Regions according to the number of replicas

For example, to filter out all Regions whose number of replicas is not 3:

```bash
» region --jq=".regions[] | {id: .id, peer_stores: [.peers[].store_id] | select(length != 3)}"
{"id":12,"peer_stores":[30,32]}
{"id":2,"peer_stores":[1,30,31,32]}
```

### Filter Regions according to the store ID of replicas

For example, to filter out all Regions that have a replica on store30:

```bash
» region --jq=".regions[] | {id: .id, peer_stores: [.peers[].store_id] | select(any(.==30))}"
{"id":6,"peer_stores":[1,30,31]}
{"id":22,"peer_stores":[1,30,32]}
...
```

You can also find out all Regions that have a replica on store30 or store31 in the same way:

```bash
» region --jq=".regions[] | {id: .id, peer_stores: [.peers[].store_id] | select(any(.==(30,31)))}"
{"id":16,"peer_stores":[1,30,34]}
{"id":28,"peer_stores":[1,30,32]}
{"id":12,"peer_stores":[30,32]}
...
```

### Look for relevant Regions when restoring data

For example, when [store1, store30, store31] is unavailable at its downtime, you can find all Regions whose Down replicas are more than normal replicas:

```bash
» region --jq=".regions[] | {id: .id, peer_stores: [.peers[].store_id] | select(length as $total | map(if .==(1,30,31) then . else empty end) | length>=$total-length) }"
{"id":2,"peer_stores":[1,30,31,32]}
{"id":12,"peer_stores":[30,32]}
{"id":14,"peer_stores":[1,30,32]}
...
```

Or when [store1, store30, store31] fails to start, you can find Regions where the data can be manually removed safely on store1. In this way, you can filter out all Regions that have a replica on store1 but don't have other DownPeers:

```bash
» region --jq=".regions[] | {id: .id, peer_stores: [.peers[].store_id] | select(length>1 and any(.==1) and all(.!=(30,31)))}"
{"id":24,"peer_stores":[1,32,33]}
```

When [store30, store31] is down, find out all Regions that can be safely processed by creating the `remove-peer` Operator, that is, Regions with one and only DownPeer:

```bash
» region --jq=".regions[] | {id: .id, remove_peer: [.peers[].store_id] | select(length>1) | map(if .==(30,31) then . else empty end) | select(length==1)}"
{"id":12,"remove_peer":[30]}
{"id":4,"remove_peer":[31]}
{"id":22,"remove_peer":[30]}
...
```
