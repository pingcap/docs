# PD Control User Guide

As a command line tool of PD, PD Control obtains the state information of the cluster and tunes the cluster.

## Install PD Control

> **Note:**
>
> It is recommended that the version of the Control tool you use is consistent with the version of the cluster.

### Use TiUP command

To use PD Control, execute the `tiup ctl:v<CLUSTER_VERSION> pd -u http://<pd_ip>:<pd_port> [-i]` command.

### Download the installation package

To obtain `pd-ctl` of the latest version, download the TiDB server installation package. `pd-ctl` is included in the `ctl-{version}-linux-{arch}.tar.gz` package.

| Installation package                                                                    | OS | Architecture | SHA256 checksum                                                    |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------- | :---- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `https://download.pingcap.org/tidb-community-server-{version}-linux-amd64.tar.gz` (pd-ctl) | Linux | amd64 | `https://download.pingcap.org/tidb-community-server-{version}-linux-amd64.tar.gz.sha256` |
| `https://download.pingcap.org/tidb-community-server-{version}-linux-arm64.tar.gz` (pd-ctl) | Linux | arm64 | `https://download.pingcap.org/tidb-community-server-{version}-linux-arm64.tar.gz.sha256` |

> **Note:**
>
> `{version}` in the link indicates the version number of TiDB. For example, the download link for `v8.1.0` in the `amd64` architecture is `https://download.pingcap.org/tidb-community-server-v8.1.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz`.

### Compile from source code

1. [Go](https://golang.org/) 1.21 or later is required because the Go modules are used.
2. In the root directory of the [PD project](https://github.com/pingcap/pd), use the `make` or `make pd-ctl` command to compile and generate `bin/pd-ctl`.

## Usage

"5.2.2"
```

- `max-snapshot-count` controls the maximum number of snapshots that a single store receives or sends out at the same time. The scheduler is restricted by this configuration to avoid taking up normal application resources. When you need to improve the speed of adding replicas or balancing, increase this value.

    ```bash
    config set max-snapshot-count 64  // Set the maximum number of snapshots to 64
    ```

- `max-pending-peer-count` controls the maximum number of pending peers in a single store. The scheduler is restricted by this configuration to avoid producing a large number of Regions without the latest log in some nodes. When you need to improve the speed of adding replicas or balancing, increase this value. Setting it to 0 indicates no limit.

    ```bash
    config set max-pending-peer-count 64  // Set the maximum number of pending peers to 64
    ```

- `max-merge-region-size` controls the upper limit on the size of Region Merge (the unit is MiB). When `regionSize` exceeds the specified value, PD does not merge it with the adjacent Region. Setting it to 0 indicates disabling Region Merge.

    ```bash
    config set max-merge-region-size 16 // Set the upper limit on the size of Region Merge to 16 MiB
    ```

- `max-merge-region-keys` controls the upper limit on the key count of Region Merge. When `regionKeyCount` exceeds the specified value, PD does not merge it with the adjacent Region.

    ```bash
    config set max-merge-region-keys 50000 // Set the upper limit on keyCount to 50000
    ```

- `split-merge-interval` controls the interval between the `split` and `merge` operations on a same Region. This means the newly split Region won't be merged within a period of time.

    ```bash
    config set split-merge-interval 24h  // Set the interval between `split` and `merge` to one day
    ```

- `enable-one-way-merge` controls whether PD only allows a Region to merge with the next Region. When you set it to `false`, PD allows a Region to merge with the adjacent two Regions.

    ```bash
    config set enable-one-way-merge true  // Enables one-way merging.
    ```

- `enable-cross-table-merge` is used to enable the merging of cross-table Regions. When you set it to `false`, PD does not merge the Regions from different tables. This option only works when key type is "table".

    ```bash
    config set enable-cross-table-merge true  // Enable cross table merge.
    ```

- `key-type` specifies the key encoding type used for the cluster. The supported options are ["table", "raw", "txn"], and the default value is "table".
    - If no TiDB instance exists in the cluster, `key-type` will be "raw" or "txn", and PD is allowed to merge Regions across tables regardless of the `enable-cross-table-merge` setting.
    - If any TiDB instance exists in the cluster, `key-type` should be "table". Whether PD can merge Regions across tables is determined by `enable-cross-table-merge`. If `key-type` is "raw", placement rules do not work.

    ```bash
    config set key-type raw  // Enable cross table merge.
    ```

- `region-score-formula-version` controls the version of the Region score formula. The value options are `v1` and `v2`. The version 2 of the formula helps to reduce redundant balance Region scheduling in some scenarios, such as taking TiKV nodes online or offline.

    {{< copyable "" >}}

    ```bash
    config set region-score-formula-version v2
    ```

- `patrol-region-interval` controls the execution frequency that `replicaChecker` checks the health status of Regions. A shorter interval indicates a higher execution frequency. Generally, you do not need to adjust it.

    ```bash
    config set patrol-region-interval 10ms // Set the execution frequency of replicaChecker to 10ms
    ```

- `max-store-down-time` controls the time that PD decides the disconnected store cannot be restored if exceeded. If PD does not receive heartbeats from a store within the specified period of time, PD adds replicas in other nodes.

    ```bash
    config set max-store-down-time 30m  // Set the time within which PD receives no heartbeats and after which PD starts to add replicas to 30 minutes
    ```

- `max-store-preparing-time` controls the maximum waiting time for the store to go online. During the online stage of a store, PD can query the online progress of the store. When the specified time is exceeded, PD assumes that the store has been online and cannot query the online progress of the store again. But this does not prevent Regions from transferring to the new online store. In most scenarios, you do not need to adjust this parameter.

    The following command specifies that the maximum waiting time for the store to go online is 4 hours.

    {{< copyable "" >}}

    ```bash
    config set max-store-preparing-time 4h
    ```

- `leader-schedule-limit` controls the number of tasks scheduling the leader at the same time. This value affects the speed of leader balance. A larger value means a higher speed and setting the value to 0 closes the scheduling. Usually the leader scheduling has a small load, and you can increase the value in need.

    ```bash
    config set leader-schedule-limit 4         // 4 tasks of leader scheduling at the same time at most
    ```

- `region-schedule-limit` controls the number of tasks of scheduling Regions at the same time. This value avoids too many Region balance operators being created. The default value is `2048` which is enough for all sizes of clusters, and setting the value to `0` closes the scheduling. Usually, the Region scheduling speed is limited by `store-limit`, but it is recommended that you do not customize this value unless you know exactly what you are doing.

    ```bash
    config set region-schedule-limit 2         // 2 tasks of Region scheduling at the same time at most
    ```

- `replica-schedule-limit` controls the number of tasks scheduling the replica at the same time. This value affects the scheduling speed when the node is down or removed. A larger value means a higher speed and setting the value to 0 closes the scheduling. Usually the replica scheduling has a large load, so do not set a too large value. Note that this configuration item is usually kept at the default value. If you want to change the value, you need to try a few values to see which one works best according to the real situation.

    ```bash
    config set replica-schedule-limit 4        // 4 tasks of replica scheduling at the same time at most
    ```

- `merge-schedule-limit` controls the number of Region Merge scheduling tasks. Setting the value to 0 closes Region Merge. Usually the Merge scheduling has a large load, so do not set a too large value. Note that this configuration item is usually kept at the default value. If you want to change the value, you need to try a few values to see which one works best according to the real situation.

    ```bash
    config set merge-schedule-limit 16       // 16 tasks of Merge scheduling at the same time at most
    ```

- `hot-region-schedule-limit` controls the hot Region scheduling tasks that are running at the same time. Setting its value to `0` means disabling the scheduling. It is not recommended to set a too large value. Otherwise, it might affect the system performance. Note that this configuration item is usually kept at the default value. If you want to change the value, you need to try a few values to see which one works best according to the real situation.

    ```bash
    config set hot-region-schedule-limit 4       // 4 tasks of hot Region scheduling at the same time at most
    ```

- `hot-region-cache-hits-threshold` is used to set the number of minutes required to identify a hot Region. PD can participate in the hotspot scheduling only after the Region is in the hotspot state for more than this number of minutes.

- `tolerant-size-ratio` controls the size of the balance buffer area. When the score difference between the leader or Region of the two stores is less than specified multiple times of the Region size, it is considered in balance by PD.

    ```bash
    config set tolerant-size-ratio 20        // Set the size of the buffer area to about 20 times of the average Region Size
    ```

- `low-space-ratio` controls the threshold value that is considered as insufficient store space. When the ratio of the space occupied by the node exceeds the specified value, PD tries to avoid migrating data to the corresponding node as much as possible. At the same time, PD mainly schedules the remaining space to avoid using up the disk space of the corresponding node.

    ```bash
    config set low-space-ratio 0.9              // Set the threshold value of insufficient space to 0.9
    ```

- `high-space-ratio` controls the threshold value that is considered as sufficient store space. This configuration takes effect only when `region-score-formula-version` is set to `v1`. When the ratio of the space occupied by the node is less than the specified value, PD ignores the remaining space and mainly schedules the actual data volume.

    ```bash
    config set high-space-ratio 0.5             // Set the threshold value of sufficient space to 0.5
    ```

- `cluster-version` is the version of the cluster, which is used to enable or disable some features and to deal with the compatibility issues. By default, it is the minimum version of all normally running TiKV nodes in the cluster. You can set it manually only when you need to roll it back to an earlier version.

    ```bash
    config set cluster-version 1.0.8              // Set the version of the cluster to 1.0.8
    ```

- `replication-mode` controls the replication mode of Regions in the dual data center scenario. See [Enable the DR Auto-Sync mode](/two-data-centers-in-one-city-deployment.md#enable-the-dr-auto-sync-mode) for details.

- `leader-schedule-policy` is used to select the scheduling strategy for the leader. You can schedule the leader according to `size` or `count`.

- `scheduler-max-waiting-operator` is used to control the number of waiting operators in each scheduler.

- `enable-remove-down-replica` is used to enable the feature of automatically deleting DownReplica. When you set it to `false`, PD does not automatically clean up the downtime replicas.

- `enable-replace-offline-replica` is used to enable the feature of migrating OfflineReplica. When you set it to `false`, PD does not migrate the offline replicas.

- `enable-make-up-replica` is used to enable the feature of making up replicas. When you set it to `false`, PD does not add replicas for Regions without sufficient replicas.

- `enable-remove-extra-replica` is used to enable the feature of removing extra replicas. When you set it to `false`, PD does not remove extra replicas for Regions with redundant replicas.

- `enable-location-replacement` is used to enable the isolation level checking. When you set it to `false`, PD does not increase the isolation level of a Region replica through scheduling.

- `enable-debug-metrics` is used to enable the metrics for debugging. When you set it to `true`, PD enables some metrics such as `balance-tolerant-size`.

- `enable-placement-rules` is used to enable placement rules, which is enabled by default in v5.0 and later versions.

- `store-limit-mode` is used to control the mode of limiting the store speed. The optional modes are `auto` and `manual`. In `auto` mode, the stores are automatically balanced according to the load (deprecated).

- `store-limit-version` controls the version of the store limit formula. In v1 mode, you can manually modify the `store limit` to limit the scheduling speed of a single TiKV. The v2 mode is an experimental feature. In v2 mode, you do not need to manually set the `store limit` value, as PD dynamically adjusts it based on the capability of TiKV snapshots. For more details, refer to [Principles of store limit v2](/configure-store-limit.md#principles-of-store-limit-v2).

    ```bash
    config set store-limit-version v2       // using store limit v2
    ```

- PD rounds the lowest digits of the flow number, which reduces the update of statistics caused by the changes of the Region flow information. This configuration item is used to specify the number of lowest digits to round for the Region flow information. For example, the flow `100512` will be rounded to `101000` because the default value is `3`. This configuration replaces `trace-region-flow`.

- For example, set the value of `flow-round-by-digit` to `4`:

    {{< copyable "" >}}

    ```bash
    config set flow-round-by-digit 4
    ```

#### `config placement-rules [disable | enable | load | save | show | rule-group]`

>> operator show region                                 // Display all Region operators
>> operator add add-peer 1 2                            // Add a replica of Region 1 on store 2
>> operator add add-learner 1 2                         // Add a learner replica of Region 1 on store 2
>> operator add remove-peer 1 2                         // Remove a replica of Region 1 on store 2
>> operator add transfer-leader 1 2                     // Schedule the leader of Region 1 to store 2
>> operator add transfer-region 1 2 3 4                 // Schedule Region 1 to stores 2,3,4
>> operator add transfer-peer 1 2 3                     // Schedule the replica of Region 1 on store 2 to store 3
>> operator add merge-region 1 2                        // Merge Region 1 with Region 2
>> operator add split-region 1 --policy=approximate     // Split Region 1 into two Regions in halves, based on approximately estimated value
>> operator add split-region 1 --policy=scan            // Split Region 1 into two Regions in halves, based on accurate scan value
>> operator remove 1                                    // Remove the scheduling operation of Region 1
>> operator check 1                                     // Check the status of the operators related to Region 1
```

The splitting of Regions starts from the position as close as possible to the middle. You can locate this position using two strategies, namely "scan" and "approximate". The difference between them is that the former determines the middle key by scanning the Region, and the latter obtains the approximate position by checking the statistics recorded in the SST file. Generally, the former is more accurate, while the latter consumes less I/O and can be completed faster.

### `ping`

Use this command to view the time that `ping` PD takes.

Usage:

```bash
>> ping
time: 43.12698ms
```

### `region <region_id> [--jq="<query string>"]`

Use this command to view the Region information. For a jq formatted output, see [jq-formatted-json-output-usage](#jq-formatted-json-output-usage).

Usage:

```bash
>> region                               //　Display the information of all Regions
{
  "count": 1,

### `region key [--format=raw|encode|hex] <key>`

Use this command to query the Region that a specific key resides in. It supports the raw, encoding, and hex formats. And you need to use single quotes around the key when it is in the encoding format.

Hex format usage (default):

```bash
>> region key 7480000000000000FF1300000000000000F8
{
  "region": {
    "id": 2,
    ......
  }
}
```

Raw format usage:

```bash
>> region key --format=raw abc
{
  "region": {
    "id": 2,
    ......
  }
}
```

Encoding format usage:

```bash
>> region key --format=encode 't\200\000\000\000\000\000\000\377\035_r\200\000\000\000\000\377\017U\320\000\000\000\000\000\372'
{
  "region": {
    "id": 2,
    ......
  }
}
```

### `region scan`

Use this command to get all Regions.

Usage:

```bash
>> region scan
{
  "count": 20,
  "regions": [......],
}
```

### `region sibling <region_id>`

Use this command to check the adjacent Regions of a specific Region.

  "regions": [......],
}
```

### `region keys [--format=raw|encode|hex] <start_key> <end_key> <limit>`

Use this command to query all Regions in a given range `[startkey, endkey)`. Ranges without `endKey`s are supported.

The `limit` parameter limits the number of keys. The default value of `limit` is `16`, and the value of `-1` means unlimited keys.

Usage:

```bash
>> region keys --format=raw a         // Display all Regions that start from the key a with a default limit count of 16
{
  "count": 16,
  "regions": [......],
}

>> region keys --format=raw a z      // Display all Regions in the range [a, z) with a default limit count of 16
{
  "count": 16,
  "regions": [......],
}

>> region keys --format=raw a z -1   // Display all Regions in the range [a, z) without a limit count
{
  "count": ...,
  "regions": [......],
}

>> region keys --format=raw a "" 20   // Display all Regions that start from the key a with a limit count of 20
{
  "count": 20,
  "regions": [......],
}
```

### `region store <store_id>`

Use this command to list all Regions of a specific store.

Usage:

```bash
>> region store 2
{
  "count": 10,
  "regions": [......],
}
```

### `region topread [limit]`

Use this command to list Regions with top read flow. The default value of the limit is 16.

Usage:

```bash
>> region topread
{
  "count": 16,
  "regions": [......],
}
```

### `region topwrite [limit]`

Use this command to list Regions with top write flow. The default value of the limit is 16.

Usage:

```bash
>> region topwrite
{
  "count": 16,
  "regions": [......],
}
```

### `region topconfver [limit]`

Use this command to list Regions with top conf version. The default value of the limit is 16.

Usage:

```bash
>> region topconfver
{
  "count": 16,
  "regions": [......],
}
```

### `region topversion [limit]`

Use this command to list Regions with top version. The default value of the limit is 16.

Usage:

```bash
>> region topversion
{
  "count": 16,
  "regions": [......],
}
```

### `region topsize [limit]`

Use this command to list Regions with top approximate size. The default value of the limit is 16.

Usage:

```bash
>> region topsize
{
  "count": 16,
  "regions": [......],
}

```

### `region check [miss-peer | extra-peer | down-peer | pending-peer | offline-peer | empty-region | hist-size | hist-keys] [--jq="<query string>"]`

Use this command to check the Regions in abnormal conditions. For a jq formatted output, see [jq formatted JSON output usage](#jq-formatted-json-output-usage).

Description of various types:

- miss-peer: the Region without enough replicas
- extra-peer: the Region with extra replicas
- down-peer: the Region in which some replicas are Down
- pending-peer: the Region in which some replicas are Pending

Usage:

```bash
>> region check miss-peer
{
  "count": 2,
  "regions": [......],
}
```

### `resource-manager [command]`

#### View the controller configuration of Resource Control

```bash
resource-manager config controller show
```

```bash
{
    "degraded-mode-wait-duration": "0s",
    "ltb-max-wait-duration": "30s",
    "request-unit": {                    # Configurations of RU. Do not modify.
        "read-base-cost": 0.125,
        "read-per-batch-base-cost": 0.5,
        "read-cost-per-byte": 0.0000152587890625,
        "write-base-cost": 1,
        "write-per-batch-base-cost": 1,
        "write-cost-per-byte": 0.0009765625,
        "read-cpu-ms-cost": 0.3333333333333333
    },
    "enable-controller-trace-log": "false"
}
```

- `ltb-max-wait-duration`: the maximum waiting time of Local Token Bucket (LTB). The default value is `30s`, and the value range is `[0, 24h]`. If the estimated [Request Unit (RU)](/tidb-resource-control.md#what-is-request-unit-ru) consumption of the SQL request exceeds the current accumulated RU of LTB, the request needs to wait for a certain period of time. If the estimated waiting time exceeds this maximum value, an error message [`ERROR 8252 (HY000) : Exceeded resource group quota limitation`](/error-codes.md) is returned to the application in advance. Increasing this value can reduce the occurrence of encountering `ERROR 8252` in cases of sudden concurrency increase, large transactions, and large queries.
- `enable-controller-trace-log`: control whether to enable the controller diagnostic log.

#### Modify the controller configuration of Resource Control

To modify the `ltb-max-wait-duration` configuration, use the following command:

```bash
pd-ctl resource-manager config controller set ltb-max-wait-duration 30m
```

### `scheduler [show | add | remove | pause | resume | config | describe]`

Use this command to view and control the scheduling policy.

Usage:

```bash
>> scheduler show                                 // Display all created schedulers
>> scheduler add grant-leader-scheduler 1         // Schedule all the leaders of the Regions on store 1 to store 1
>> scheduler add evict-leader-scheduler 1         // Move all the Region leaders on store 1 out
>> scheduler config evict-leader-scheduler        // Display the stores in which the scheduler is located since v4.0.0
>> scheduler add shuffle-leader-scheduler         // Randomly exchange the leader on different stores
>> scheduler add shuffle-region-scheduler         // Randomly scheduling the Regions on different stores
>> scheduler add evict-slow-store-scheduler       // When there is one and only one slow store, evict all Region leaders of that store
>> scheduler remove grant-leader-scheduler-1      // Remove the corresponding scheduler, and `-1` corresponds to the store ID
>> scheduler pause balance-region-scheduler 10    // Pause the balance-region scheduler for 10 seconds
>> scheduler pause all 10                         // Pause all schedulers for 10 seconds
>> scheduler resume balance-region-scheduler      // Continue to run the balance-region scheduler
>> scheduler resume all                           // Continue to run all schedulers
>> scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler  // Display the configuration of the balance-hot-region scheduler
>> scheduler describe balance-region-scheduler    // Display the running state and related diagnostic information of the balance-region scheduler
```

### `scheduler describe balance-region-scheduler`

Use this command to view the running state and related diagnostic information of the `balance-region-scheduler`.

Since TiDB v6.3.0, PD provides the running state and brief diagnostic information for `balance-region-scheduler` and `balance-leader-scheduler`. Other schedulers and checkers are not supported yet. To enable this feature, you can modify the [`enable-diagnostic`](/pd-configuration-file.md#enable-diagnostic-new-in-v630) configuration item using `pd-ctl`.

The state of the scheduler can be one of the following:

- `disabled`: the scheduler is unavailable or removed.
- `paused`: the scheduler is paused.
- `scheduling`: the scheduler is generating scheduling operators.
- `pending`: the scheduler cannot generate scheduling operators. For a scheduler in the `pending` state, brief diagnostic information is returned. The brief information describes the state of stores and explains why these stores cannot be selected for scheduling.
- `normal`: there is no need to generate scheduling operators.

### `scheduler config balance-leader-scheduler`

Use this command to view and control the `balance-leader-scheduler` policy.

Since TiDB v6.0.0, PD introduces the `Batch` parameter for `balance-leader-scheduler` to control the speed at which the balance-leader processes tasks. To use this parameter, you can modify the `balance-leader batch` configuration item using pd-ctl.

Before v6.0.0, PD does not have this configuration item, which means `balance-leader batch=1`. In v6.0.0 or later versions, the default value of `balance-leader batch` is `4`. To set this configuration item to a value greater than `4`, you need to set a greater value for [`scheduler-max-waiting-operator`](#config-show--set-option-value--placement-rules) (whose default value is `5`) at the same time. You can get the expected acceleration effect only after modifying both configuration items.

```bash
scheduler config balance-leader-scheduler set batch 3 // Set the size of the operator that the balance-leader scheduler can execute in a batch to 3
```

#### `scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler`

Use this command to view and control the `balance-hot-region-scheduler` policy.

Usage:

```bash
>> scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler  // Display all configuration of the balance-hot-region scheduler
{
  "min-hot-byte-rate": 100,
  "min-hot-key-rate": 10,
  "min-hot-query-rate": 10,
  "max-zombie-rounds": 3,
  "max-peer-number": 1000,
  "byte-rate-rank-step-ratio": 0.05,
  "key-rate-rank-step-ratio": 0.05,
  "query-rate-rank-step-ratio": 0.05,
  "count-rank-step-ratio": 0.01,
  "great-dec-ratio": 0.95,
  "minor-dec-ratio": 0.99,
  "src-tolerance-ratio": 1.05,
  "dst-tolerance-ratio": 1.05,
  "read-priorities": [
    "query",
    "byte"
  ],
  "write-leader-priorities": [
    "key",
    "byte"
  ],
  "write-peer-priorities": [
    "byte",
    "key"
  ],
  "strict-picking-store": "true",
  "enable-for-tiflash": "true",
  "rank-formula-version": "v2"
}
```

- `min-hot-byte-rate` means the smallest number of bytes to be counted, which is usually 100.

    ```bash
    scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler set min-hot-byte-rate 100
    ```

- `min-hot-key-rate` means the smallest number of keys to be counted, which is usually 10.

    ```bash
    scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler set min-hot-key-rate 10
    ```

- `min-hot-query-rate` means the smallest number of queries to be counted, which is usually 10.

    ```bash
    scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler set min-hot-query-rate 10
    ```

- `max-zombie-rounds` means the maximum number of heartbeats with which an operator can be considered as the pending influence. If you set it to a larger value, more operators might be included in the pending influence. Usually, you do not need to adjust its value. Pending influence refers to the operator influence that is generated during scheduling but still has an effect.

    ```bash
    scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler set max-zombie-rounds 3
    ```

- `max-peer-number` means the maximum number of peers to be solved, which prevents the scheduler from being too slow.

    ```bash
    scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler set max-peer-number 1000
    ```

- `byte-rate-rank-step-ratio`, `key-rate-rank-step-ratio`, `query-rate-rank-step-ratio`, and `count-rank-step-ratio` respectively mean the step ranks of byte, key, query, and count. The rank-step-ratio decides the step when the rank is calculated. `great-dec-ratio` and `minor-dec-ratio` are used to determine the `dec` rank. Usually, you do not need to modify these items.

    ```bash
    scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler set byte-rate-rank-step-ratio 0.05
    ```

- `src-tolerance-ratio` and `dst-tolerance-ratio` are configuration items for the expectation scheduler. The smaller the `tolerance-ratio`, the easier it is for scheduling. When redundant scheduling occurs, you can appropriately increase this value.

    ```bash
    scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler set src-tolerance-ratio 1.1
    ```

- `read-priorities`, `write-leader-priorities`, and `write-peer-priorities` control which dimension the scheduler prioritizes for hot Region scheduling. Two dimensions are supported for configuration.

    - `read-priorities` and `write-leader-priorities` control which dimensions the scheduler prioritizes for scheduling hot Regions of the read and write-leader types. The dimension options are `query`, `byte`, and `key`.
    - `write-peer-priorities` controls which dimensions the scheduler prioritizes for scheduling hot Regions of the write-peer type. The dimension options are `byte` and `key`.

    > **Note:**
    >
    > If a cluster component is earlier than v5.2, the configuration of `query` dimension does not take effect. If some components are upgraded to v5.2 or later, the `byte` and `key` dimensions still by default have the priority for hot Region scheduling. After all components of the cluster are upgraded to v5.2 or later, such a configuration still takes effect for compatibility. You can view the real-time configuration using the `pd-ctl` command. Usually, you do not need to modify these configurations.

    ```bash
    scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler set read-priorities query,byte
    ```

- `strict-picking-store` controls the search space of hot Region scheduling. Usually, it is enabled. This configuration item only affects the behavior when `rank-formula-version` is `v1`. When it is enabled, hot Region scheduling ensures hot Region balance on the two configured dimensions. When it is disabled, hot Region scheduling only ensures the balance on the dimension with the first priority, which might reduce balance on other dimensions. Usually, you do not need to modify this configuration.

    ```bash
    scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler set strict-picking-store true
    ```

- `rank-formula-version` controls which scheduler algorithm version is used in hot Region scheduling. Value options are `v1` and `v2`. The default value is `v2`.

    - The `v1` algorithm is the scheduler strategy used in TiDB v6.3.0 and earlier versions. This algorithm mainly focuses on reducing load difference between stores and avoids introducing side effects in the other dimension.
    - The `v2` algorithm is an experimental scheduler strategy introduced in TiDB v6.3.0 and is in General Availability (GA) in TiDB v6.4.0. This algorithm mainly focuses on improving the rate of the equitability between stores and factors in few side effects. Compared with the `v1` algorithm with `strict-picking-store` being `true`, the `v2` algorithm pays more attention to the priority equalization of the first dimension. Compared with the `v1` algorithm with `strict-picking-store` being `false`, the `v2` algorithm considers the balance of the second dimension.
    - The `v1` algorithm with `strict-picking-store` being `true` is conservative and scheduling can only be generated when there is a store with a high load in both dimensions. In certain scenarios, it might be impossible to continue balancing due to dimensional conflicts. To achieve better balancing in the first dimension, it is necessary to set the `strict-picking-store` to `false`. The `v2` algorithm can achieve better balancing in both dimensions and reduce invalid scheduling.

  ```bash
  scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler set rank-formula-version v2
  ```

- `enable-for-tiflash` controls whether hot Region scheduling takes effect for TiFlash instances. Usually, it is enabled. When it is disabled, the hot Region scheduling between TiFlash instances is not performed.

    ```bash
    scheduler config balance-hot-region-scheduler set enable-for-tiflash true
    ```

### `service-gc-safepoint`

Use this command to query the current GC safepoint and service GC safepoint. The output is as follows:

```bash
{
  "service_gc_safe_points": [
    {
      "service_id": "gc_worker",
      "expired_at": 9223372036854775807,
      "safe_point": 439923410637160448
    }
  ],
  "gc_safe_point": 0
}
```

### `store [delete | cancel-delete | label | weight | remove-tombstone | limit ] <store_id> [--jq="<query string>"]`

For a jq formatted output, see [jq-formatted-json-output-usage](#jq-formatted-json-output-usage).

#### Get a store

To display the information of all stores, run the following command:

```bash
store
```

```
{
  "count": 3,
  "stores": [...]
}
```

To get the store with id of 1, run the following command:

```bash
store 1
```

```
......
```

#### Delete a store

To delete the store with id of 1, run the following command:

```bash
store delete 1
```

To cancel deleting `Offline` state stores which are deleted using `store delete`, run the `store cancel-delete` command. After canceling, the store changes from `Offline` to `Up`. Note that the `store cancel-delete` command cannot change a `Tombstone` state store to the `Up` state.

To cancel deleting the store with id of 1, run the following command:

```bash
store cancel-delete 1
```

To delete all stores in `Tombstone` state, run the following command:

```bash
store remove-tombstone
```

> **Note:**
>
> If the PD leader changes during store deletion, you need to modify the store limit manually using the [`store limit`](#configure-store-scheduling-speed) command.

#### Manage store labels

To manage the labels of a store, run the `store label` command.

- To set a label with the key being `"zone"` and value being `"cn"` to the store with id of 1, run the following command:

    ```bash
    store label 1 zone=cn
    ```

- To update the label of a store, for example, changing the value of the key `"zone"` from `"cn"` to `"us"` for the store with id of 1, run the following command:

    ```bash
    store label 1 zone=us
    ```

- To rewrite all labels of a store with id of 1, use the `--rewrite` option. Note that this option overwrites all existing labels:

    ```bash
    store label 1 region=us-est-1 disk=ssd --rewrite
    ```

- To delete the `"disk"` label for the store with id of 1, use the `--delete` option:

    ```bash
    store label 1 disk --delete
    ```

> **Note:**
>
> - The label of a store is updated by merging the label in TiKV and that in PD. Specifically, after you modify a store label in the TiKV configuration file and restart the cluster, PD merges its own store label with the TiKV store label, updates the label, and persists the merged result.
> - To manage labels of a store using TiUP, you can run the `store label <id> --force` command to empty the labels stored in PD before restarting the cluster.

#### Configure store weight

To set the leader weight to 5 and Region weight to 10 for the store with id of 1, run the following command:

```bash
store weight 1 5 10
```

#### Configure store scheduling speed

You can set the scheduling speed of stores by using `store limit`. For more details about the principles and usage of `store limit`, see [`store limit`](/configure-store-limit.md).

```bash
>> store limit                         // Show the speed limit of adding-peer operations and the limit of removing-peer operations per minute in all stores
>> store limit add-peer                // Show the speed limit of adding-peer operations per minute in all stores
>> store limit remove-peer             // Show the limit of removing-peer operations per minute in all stores
>> store limit all 5                   // Set the limit of adding-peer operations to 5 and the limit of removing-peer operations to 5 per minute for all stores
>> store limit 1 5                     // Set the limit of adding-peer operations to 5 and the limit of removing-peer operations to 5 per minute for store 1
>> store limit all 5 add-peer          // Set the limit of adding-peer operations to 5 per minute for all stores
>> store limit 1 5 add-peer            // Set the limit of adding-peer operations to 5 per minute for store 1
>> store limit 1 5 remove-peer         // Set the limit of removing-peer operations to 5 per minute for store 1
>> store limit all 5 remove-peer       // Set the limit of removing-peer operations to 5 per minute for all stores
```

> **Note:**
>
> You can use `pd-ctl` to check the state (`Up`, `Disconnect`, `Offline`, `Down`, or `Tombstone`) of a TiKV store. For the relationship between each state, refer to [Relationship between each state of a TiKV store](/tidb-scheduling.md#information-collection).

### `log [fatal | error | warn | info | debug]`

Use this command to set the log level of the PD leader.

Usage:

```bash
log warn
```

### `tso`

Use this command to parse the physical and logical time of TSO.

Usage:

```bash
>> tso 395181938313123110        // Parse TSO
system:  2017-10-09 05:50:59 +0800 CST
logic:  120102
```

### `unsafe remove-failed-stores [store-ids | show]`

> **Warning:**
>
> - This feature is a lossy recovery, so TiKV cannot guarantee data integrity and data indexes integrity after using the feature.
> - It is recommended to perform the feature-related operations with the support from the TiDB team. If any misoperation is performed, it might be hard to recover the cluster.

Use this command to perform lossy recovery operations when permanently damaged replicas cause data to be unavailable. See the following example. The details are described in [Online Unsafe Recovery](/online-unsafe-recovery.md)

Execute Online Unsafe Recovery to remove permanently damaged stores:

```bash
unsafe remove-failed-stores 101,102,103
```

```bash
Success!
```

Show the current or historical state of Online Unsafe Recovery:

```bash
unsafe remove-failed-stores show
```

```bash
[
  "Collecting cluster info from all alive stores, 10/12.",
  "Stores that have reports to PD: 1, 2, 3, ...",
  "Stores that have not reported to PD: 11, 12",
]
```

## Jq formatted JSON output usage

### Simplify the output of `store`

```bash
>> store --jq=".stores[].store | { id, address, state_name}"
{"id":1,"address":"127.0.0.1:20161","state_name":"Up"}
{"id":30,"address":"127.0.0.1:20162","state_name":"Up"}
...
```

### Query the remaining space of the node

```bash
>> store --jq=".stores[] | {id: .store.id, available: .status.available}"
{"id":1,"available":"10 GiB"}
{"id":30,"available":"10 GiB"}
...
```

### Query all nodes whose status is not `Up`

{{< copyable "" >}}

```bash
store --jq='.stores[].store | select(.state_name!="Up") | { id, address, state_name}'
```

```
{"id":1,"address":"127.0.0.1:20161""state_name":"Offline"}
{"id":5,"address":"127.0.0.1:20162""state_name":"Offline"}
...
```

### Query all TiFlash nodes

{{< copyable "" >}}

```bash
store --jq='.stores[].store | select(.labels | length>0 and contains([{"key":"engine","value":"tiflash"}])) | { id, address, state_name}'
```

```
{"id":1,"address":"127.0.0.1:20161""state_name":"Up"}
{"id":5,"address":"127.0.0.1:20162""state_name":"Up"}
...
```

### Query the distribution status of the Region replicas

```bash
>> region --jq=".regions[] | {id: .id, peer_stores: [.peers[].store_id]}"
{"id":2,"peer_stores":[1,30,31]}
{"id":4,"peer_stores":[1,31,34]}
...
```

### Filter Regions according to the number of replicas

For example, to filter out all Regions whose number of replicas is not 3:

```bash
>> region --jq=".regions[] | {id: .id, peer_stores: [.peers[].store_id] | select(length != 3)}"
{"id":12,"peer_stores":[30,32]}
{"id":2,"peer_stores":[1,30,31,32]}
```

### Filter Regions according to the store ID of replicas

For example, to filter out all Regions that have a replica on store30:

```bash
>> region --jq=".regions[] | {id: .id, peer_stores: [.peers[].store_id] | select(any(.==30))}"
{"id":6,"peer_stores":[1,30,31]}
{"id":22,"peer_stores":[1,30,32]}
...

You can also find out all Regions that have a replica on store30 or store31 in the same way:

```bash
>> region --jq=".regions[] | {id: .id, peer_stores: [.peers[].store_id] | select(any(.==(30,31)))}"
{"id":16,"peer_stores":[1,30,34]}
{"id":28,"peer_stores":[1,30,32]}
{"id":12,"peer_stores":[30,32]}
...
```

### Look for relevant Regions when restoring data

For example, when [store1, store30, store31] is unavailable at its downtime, you can find all Regions whose Down replicas are more than normal replicas:

```bash
>> region --jq=".regions[] | {id: .id, peer_stores: [.peers[].store_id] | select(length as $total | map(if .==(1,30,31) then . else empty end) | length>=$total-length) }"
{"id":2,"peer_stores":[1,30,31,32]}
{"id":12,"peer_stores":[30,32]}
{"id":14,"peer_stores":[1,30,32]}
...
```

Or when [store1, store30, store31] fails to start, you can find Regions where the data can be manually removed safely on store1. In this way, you can filter out all Regions that have a replica on store1 but don't have other DownPeers:

```bash
>> region --jq=".regions[] | {id: .id, peer_stores: [.peers[].store_id] | select(length>1 and any(.==1) and all(.!=(30,31)))}"
{"id":24,"peer_stores":[1,32,33]}
```

When [store30, store31] is down, find out all Regions that can be safely processed by creating the `remove-peer` Operator, that is, Regions with one and only DownPeer:

```bash
>> region --jq=".regions[] | {id: .id, remove_peer: [.peers[].store_id] | select(length>1) | map(if .==(30,31) then . else empty end) | select(length==1)}"
{"id":12,"remove_peer":[30]}
{"id":4,"remove_peer":[31]}
{"id":22,"remove_peer":[30]}
...
```
