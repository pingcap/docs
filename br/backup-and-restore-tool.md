# BR Tool Overview

[BR](http://github.com/pingcap/br) (Backup & Restore) is a command-line tool for distributed backup and restoration of the TiDB cluster data. It is supported to use BR only in TiDB v3.1 and later versions.

Compared with [`dumpling`](/backup-and-restore-using-dumpling-lightning.md), BR is more suitable for scenarios of huge data volume.

This document describes BR's implementation principles, recommended deployment configuration, usage restrictions, several methods to use BR, etc.

## Implementation principles

BR sends the backup or restoration commands to each TiKV node. After receiving these commands, TiKV performs the corresponding backup or restoration operations.

Each TiKV node has a path in which the backup files generated in the backup operation are stored and from which the stored backup files are read during the restoration.

<summary>Backup principle</summary>

When BR performs a backup operation, it first obtains the following information from PD:

- The current TS (timestamp) as the time of the backup snapshot
- The TiKV node information of the current cluster

According to these information, BR starts a TiDB instance internally to obtain the database or table information corresponding to the TS, and filters out the system databases (`information_schema`, `performance_schema`, `mysql`) at the same time.

According to the backup sub-command, BR adopts the following two types of backup logic:

- Full backup: BR traverses all the tables and constructs the KV range to be backed up according to each table.
- Single table backup: BR constructs the KV range to be backed up according a single table.

Finally, BR collects the KV range to be backed up and sends the complete backup request to the TiKV node of the cluster.

The structure of the request:

```
BackupRequest{
    ClusterId,      // The cluster ID.
    StartKey,       // The starting key of the backup (backed up).
    EndKey,         // The ending key of the backup (not backed up).
    StartVersion,   // The version of the last backup snapshot, used for the incremental backup.
    EndVersion,     // The backup snapshot time.
    StorageBackend, // The path where backup files are stored.
    RateLimit,      // Backup speed (MB/s).
}
```

After receiving the backup request, the TiKV node traverses all Region leaders on the node to find the Regions that overlap with the KV ranges in this request. The TiKV node backs up some or all of the data within the range, and generates the corresponding SST file.

After finishing backing up the data of the corresponding Region, the TiKV node returns the metadata to BR. BR collects the metadata and stores it in the `backupmeta` file which is used for restoration.

If `StartVersion` is not `0`, the backup is seen as an incremental backup. In addition to KVs, BR also collects DDLs between `[StartVersion, EndVersion)`. During data restoration, these DDLs are restored first.

If checksum is enabled when you execute the backup command, BR calculates the checksum of each backed up table for data check.

### Types of backup files

Two types of backup files are generated in the path where backup files are stored:

- **The SST file**: stores the data that the TiKV node backed up.
- **The `backupmeta` file**: stores the metadata of this backup operation, including the number, the key range, the size, and the Hash (sha256) value of the backup files.
- **The `backup.lock` file**: prevents multiple backup operations from storing data to the same directory.

### The format of the SST file name

The SST file is named in the format of `storeID_regionID_regionEpoch_keyHash_cf`, where

- `storeID` is the TiKV node ID;
- `regionID` is the Region ID;
- `regionEpoch` is the version number of the Region;
- `keyHash` is the Hash (sha256) value of the startKey of a range, which ensures the uniqueness of a key;
- `cf` indicates the [Column Family](/tune-tikv-memory-performance.md) of RocksDB (`default` or `write` by default).

<summary>Restoration principle</summary>

During the data restoration process, BR performs the following tasks in order:

1. It parses the `backupmeta` file in the backup path, and then starts a TiDB instance internally to create the corresponding databases and tables based on the parsed information.

2. It aggregates the parsed SST files according to the tables.

3. It pre-splits Regions according to the key range of the SST file so that every Region corresponds to at least one SST file.

4. It traverses each table to be restored and the SST file corresponding to each tables.

5. It finds the Region corresponding to the SST file and sends a request to the corresponding TiKV node for downloading the file. Then it sends a request for loading the file after the file is successfully downloaded.

After TiKV receives the request to load the SST file, TiKV uses the Raft mechanism to ensure the strong consistency of the SST data. After the downloaded SST file is loaded successfully, the file is deleted asynchronously.

After the restoration operation is completed, BR performs a checksum calculation on the restored data to compare the stored data with the backed up data.

## Deploy and use BR

## Recommended deployment configuration

- It is recommended that you deploy BR on the PD node.
- It is recommended that you mount a high-performance SSD to BR nodes and all TiKV nodes. A 10-gigabit network card is recommended. Otherwise, bandwidth is likely to be the performance bottleneck during the backup and restore process.

> **Note:**
>
> - If you do not mount a network disk or use other shared storage, the data backed up by BR will be generated on each TiKV node. Because BR only backs up leader replicas, you should estimate the space reserved for each node based on the leader size.
>
> - Meanwhile, because TiDB v4.0 uses leader count for load balancing by default, leaders are greatly different in size, resulting in uneven distribution of backup data on each node.

### Usage restrictions

The following are the limitations of using BR for backup and restoration:

- It is supported to use BR only in TiDB v3.1 and later versions.
- When BR restores data to the upstream cluster of TiCDC/Drainer, TiCDC/Drainer cannot replicate the restored data to the downstream.
- BR supports operations only between clusters with the same [`new_collations_enabled_on_first_bootstrap`](/character-set-and-collation.md#collation-support-framework) value because BR only backs up KV data. If the cluster to be backed up and the cluster to be restored use different collations, the data validation fails. Therefore, before restoring a cluster, make sure that the switch value from the query result of the `select VARIABLE_VALUE from mysql.tidb where VARIABLE_NAME='new_collation_enabled';` statement is consistent with that during the backup process.

    - For v3.1 clusters, the new collation framework is not supported, so you can see it as disabled.
    - For v4.0 clusters, check whether the new collation is enabled by executing `SELECT VARIABLE_VALUE FROM mysql.tidb WHERE VARIABLE_NAME='new_collation_enabled';`.

    For example, assume that data is backed up from a v3.1 cluster and will be restored to a v4.0 cluster. The `new_collation_enabled` value of the v4.0 cluster is `true`, which means that the new collation is enabled in the cluster to be restored when this cluster is created. If you perform the restore in this situation, an error might occur.

### Minimum machine configuration required for running BR

The minimum machine configuration required for running BR is as follows:

| CPU | Memory | Hard Disk Type | Network |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 core | 4 GB | HDD | Gigabit network card |

In general scenarios (less than 1000 tables for backup and restore), the CPU consumption of BR at runtime does not exceed 200%, and the memory consumption does not exceed 1 GB. However, when backing up and restoring a large number of tables, BR might consume more than 3 GB of memory. In a test of backing up 24000 tables, BR consumes about 2.7 GB of memory, and the CPU consumption remains below 100%.

### Best practices

The following are some recommended operations for using BR for backup and restoration:

- It is recommended that you perform the backup operation during off-peak hours to minimize the impact on applications.
- BR supports restore on clusters of different topologies. However, the online applications will be greatly impacted during the restore operation. It is recommended that you perform restore during the off-peak hours or use `rate-limit` to limit the rate.
- It is recommended that you execute multiple backup operations serially. Running different backup operations in parallel reduces backup performance and also affects the online application.
- It is recommended that you execute multiple restore operations serially. Running different restore operations in parallel increases Region conflicts and also reduces restore performance.
- It is recommended that you mount a shared storage (for example, NFS) on the backup path specified by `-s`, to make it easier to collect and manage backup files.
- It is recommended that you use a storage hardware with high throughput, because the throughput of a storage hardware limits the backup and restoration speed.

### How to use BR

Currently, the following methods are supported to run the BR tool:

- Use SQL statements
- Use the command-line tool
- Use BR In the Kubernetes environment

#### Use SQL statements

In TiDB v4.0.2 and later versions, you can run the BR tool using SQL statements.

For detailed operations, see the following documents:

- [Backup syntax](/sql-statements/sql-statement-backup.md#backup)
- [Restore syntax](/sql-statements/sql-statement-restore.md#restore)

#### Use the command-line tool

In TiDB versions above v3.1, you can run the BR tool using the command-line tool.

First, you need to download the binary file of the BR tool. See [download link](/download-ecosystem-tools.md#br-backup-and-restore).

For how to use the command-line tool to perform backup and restore operations, see [Use the BR command-line tool](/br/use-br-command-line-tool.md).

#### In the Kubernetes environment

In the Kubernetes environment, you can use the BR tool to back up TiDB cluster data to S3-compatible storage, Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and persistent volumes (PV), and restore them:
