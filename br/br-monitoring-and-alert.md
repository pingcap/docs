# Monitoring and Alert for Backup and Restore

This document describes the monitoring and alert of the backup and restore feature, including how to deploy monitoring components, monitoring metrics, and common alerts.

## Log backup monitoring

Log backup supports using [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to collect monitoring metrics. Currently all monitoring metrics are built into TiKV.

### Monitoring configuration

- For clusters deployed using TiUP, Prometheus automatically collects monitoring metrics.
- For clusters deployed manually, follow the instructions in [TiDB Cluster Monitoring Deployment](/deploy-monitoring-services.md) to add TiKV-related jobs to the `scrape_configs` section of the Prometheus configuration file.

### Grafana configuration

- For clusters deployed using TiUP, the [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboard contains the point-in-time recovery (PITR) panel. The **Backup Log** panel in the TiKV-Details dashboard is the PITR panel.
- For clusters deployed manually, refer to [Import a Grafana dashboard](/deploy-monitoring-services.md#step-2-import-a-grafana-dashboard) and upload the [tikv_details](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/master/metrics/grafana/tikv_details.json) JSON file to Grafana. Then find the **Backup Log** panel in the TiKV-Details dashboard.

### Monitoring metrics

| Metrics                                                | Type    |  Description                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **tikv_log_backup_initial_scan_reason**               | Counter   | Statistics of the reasons why initial scan is triggered. The main reason is leader transfer or Region version change. <br/> `reason :: {"leader-changed", "region-changed", "retry"}`                                           |
| **tikv_log_backup_event_handle_duration_sec**         | Histogram | The duration of handling KV events. Compared with `tikv_log_backup_on_event_duration_seconds`, this metric also includes the duration of internal conversion. <br/>`stage :: {"to_stream_event", "save_to_temp_file"}` |
| **tikv_log_backup_handle_kv_batch**                   | Histogram |  Region-level statistics of the sizes of KV pair batches sent by Raftstore.                                                                                                    |
| **tikv_log_backup_initial_scan_disk_read**            | Counter   | The size of data read from the disk during initial scan. In Linux, this information is from procfs, which is the size of data actually read from the block device. The configuration item `initial-scan-rate-limit` applies to this metric.                                   |
| **tikv_log_backup_incremental_scan_bytes**            | Histogram | The size of KV pairs actually generated during initial scan. Because of compression and read amplification, this value might be different from that of `tikv_log_backup_initial_scan_disk_read`.                                                                  |

| **tikv_log_backup_errors**                            | Counter   | The errors that can be retried or ignored during the log backup. <br/>`type :: ErrorType`                                                                                                       |
| **tikv_log_backup_fatal_errors**                      | Counter   | The errors that cannot be retried or ignored during the log backup. When an error of this type occurs, the log backup is paused. <br/>`type :: ErrorType`                                                                                   |

| **tikv_log_backup_on_event_duration_seconds**         | Histogram |  The duration of storing KV events to temporary files. <br/>`stage :: {"write_to_tempfile", "syscall_write"}`                                                                        |

| **tikv_log_backup_enabled**                           | Counter   |  Whether to enable log backup. If the value is greater than `0`, log backup is enabled.                                                                                                                                |

### Log backup alerts

#### Alert configuration

Currently, PITR does not have built-in alert items. This section introduces how to configure alert items in PITR and recommends some items.

To configure alert items in PITR, follow these steps:

1. Create a configuration file (for example, `pitr.rules.yml`) for the alert rules on the node where Prometheus is located. In the file, fill in the alert rules according to the [Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/), the following recommended alert items, and the configuration sample.
2. In the `rule_files` field of the Prometheus configuration file, add the path of the alert rule file.
3. Send `SIGHUP` signal to the Prometheus process (`kill -HUP pid`) or send an HTTP `POST` request to `http://prometheus-addr/-/reload` (before you send the HTTP request, add the `--web.enable-lifecycle` parameter when starting Prometheus).

The recommended alert items are as follows:

#### LogBackupRunningRPOMoreThan10m

- Alert item: `max(time() - tidb_log_backup_last_checkpoint / 262144000) by (task) / 60 > 10 and max(tidb_log_backup_last_checkpoint) by (task) > 0 and max(tikv_log_backup_task_status) by (task) == 0`
- Alert level: warning
- Description: The log data is not persisted to the storage for more than 10 minutes. This alert item is a reminder. In most cases, it does not affect log backup.

A configuration sample of this alert item is as follows:

```yaml
groups:
- name: PiTR
  rules:
  - alert: LogBackupRunningRPOMoreThan10m
    expr: max(time() - tidb_log_backup_last_checkpoint / 262144000) by (task) / 60 > 10 and max(tidb_log_backup_last_checkpoint) by (task) > 0 and max(tikv_log_backup_task_status) by (task) == 0
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: RPO of log backup is high
      message: RPO of the log backup task {{ $labels.task }} is more than 10m
```

#### LogBackupRunningRPOMoreThan30m

- Alert item: `max(time() - tidb_log_backup_last_checkpoint / 262144000) by (task) / 60 > 30 and max(tidb_log_backup_last_checkpoint) by (task) > 0 and max(tikv_log_backup_task_status) by (task) == 0`
- Alert level: critical
- Description: The log data is not persisted to the storage for more than 30 minutes. This alert often indicates anomalies. You can check the TiKV logs to find the cause.

#### LogBackupPausingMoreThan2h

- Alert item: `max(time() - tidb_log_backup_last_checkpoint / 262144000) by (task) / 3600 > 2 and max(tidb_log_backup_last_checkpoint) by (task) > 0 and max(tikv_log_backup_task_status) by (task) == 1`
- Alert level: warning
- Description: The log backup task is paused for more than 2 hours. This alert item is a reminder and you are expected to run `br log resume` as soon as possible.

#### LogBackupPausingMoreThan12h

- Alert item: `max(time() - tidb_log_backup_last_checkpoint / 262144000) by (task) / 3600 > 12 and max(tidb_log_backup_last_checkpoint) by (task) > 0 and max(tikv_log_backup_task_status) by (task) == 1`
- Alert level: critical
- Description: The log backup task is paused for more than 12 hours. You are expected to run `br log resume` as soon as possible to resume the task. Log tasks paused for too long have the risk of data loss.

#### LogBackupFailed

- Alert item: `max(tikv_log_backup_task_status) by (task) == 2 and max(tidb_log_backup_last_checkpoint) by (task) > 0`
- Alert level: critical
- Description: The log backup task fails. You need to run `br log status` to see the failure reason. If necessary, you need to further check the TiKV logs.

#### LogBackupGCSafePointExceedsCheckpoint

- Alert item: `min(tidb_log_backup_last_checkpoint) by (instance) - max(tikv_gcworker_autogc_safe_point) by (instance) < 0`
- Alert level: critical
- Description: Some data has been garbage-collected before the backup. This means that some data has been lost and is very likely to affect your services.
