# BR Design Principles

This document describes the design principles of Backup & Restore (BR), including its architecture and backup files.

## BR architecture

BR sends a backup or restoration command to each TiKV node. After receiving the command, TiKV performs the corresponding backup or restoration operation.

Each TiKV node has a path in which the backup files generated in the backup operation are stored and from which the stored backup files are read during the restoration.

## Backup files

This section describes the design of backup files generated by BR.

### Types of backup files

BR can generate the following types of backup files:

- `SST` file: stores the data that the TiKV node backs up.
- `backupmeta` file: stores the metadata of a backup operation, including the number, the key range, the size, and the Hash (sha256) value of the backup files.
- `backup.lock` file: prevents multiple backup operations from storing data to the same directory.

### Naming format of SST files

SST files are named in the format of `storeID_regionID_regionEpoch_keyHash_cf`. The fields in the format are explained as follows:

- `storeID` is the TiKV node ID.
- `regionID` is the Region ID.
- `regionEpoch` is the version number of a Region.
- `keyHash` is the Hash (sha256) value of the startKey of a range, which ensures the uniqueness of a key.
- `cf` indicates the Column Family of RocksDB (`default` or `write` by default).

### Storage format of SST files

- For details about the storage format of SST files, see [Rocksdb BlockBasedTable Format](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Rocksdb-BlockBasedTable-Format).
- For details about the encoding format of backup data in SST files, see [Mapping of table data to Key-Value](/tidb-computing.md#mapping-of-table-data-to-key-value).
