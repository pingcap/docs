# Back Up and Restore RawKV

TiKV and PD can constitute a KV database when used without TiDB, which is called RawKV. TiKV-BR supports data backup and restore for products that use RawKV. 

For more details, see [TiKV-BR User Docs](https://tikv.org/docs/latest/concepts/explore-tikv-features/backup-restore/).
