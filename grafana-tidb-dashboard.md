# TiDB Monitoring Metrics

If you use TiDB Ansible to deploy the TiDB cluster, the monitoring system is deployed at the same time. For more information, see [TiDB Monitoring Framework Overview](/tidb-monitoring-framework.md).

The Grafana dashboard is divided into a series of sub dashboards which include Overview, PD, TiDB, TiKV, Node\_exporter, Disk Performance, and so on. A lot of metrics are there to help you diagnose.

This document describes some key monitoring metrics displayed on the TiDB dashboard.
