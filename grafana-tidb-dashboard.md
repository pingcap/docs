# TiDB Monitoring Metrics

If you use TiDB Ansible or TiUP to deploy the TiDB cluster, the monitoring system (Prometheus & Grafana) is deployed at the same time. For the monitoring architecture, see [TiDB Monitoring Framework Overview](/tidb-monitoring-framework.md).

The Grafana dashboard is divided into a series of sub dashboards which include Overview, PD, TiDB, TiKV, Node\_exporter, Disk Performance, and so on. The TiDB dashboard consists of the TiDB panel and the TiDB Summary panel. The differences between the two panels are different in the following aspects:

- TiDB panel: provides as comprehensive information as possible for troubleshooting cluster anomalies.
- TiDB Summary Panel: extracts parts of the TiDB panel information with which users are most concerned, with some modifications. It provides data (such as QPS, TPS, response delay) that users care about in the daily database operations, which serves as the monitoring information to be displayed or reported.

This document describes some key monitoring metrics displayed on the TiDB dashboard.

## Key metrics description

To understand the key metrics displayed on the TiDB dashboard, check the following list:

- Query Summary
    - Duration: execution time
        - The duration between the time that the client's network request is sent to TiDB and the time that the request is returned to the client after TiDB has executed it. In general, client requests are sent in the form of SQL statements, but can also include the execution time of commands such as `COM_PING`, `COM_SLEEP`, `COM_STMT_FETCH`, and `COM_SEND_LONG_DATA`
        - Because TiDB supports Multi-Query, it supports sending multiple SQL statements at one time, such as `select 1; select 1; select 1;`. In this case, the total execution time of this query includes the execution time of all SQL statements
    - QPS: the number of SQL statements executed per second on all TiDB instances. The execution results are classified into `OK` (successful) and `Error` (failed)
    - Statement OPS: the number of different types of SQL statements executed per second, which is counted according to `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and other types of statements
    - QPS By Instance: the QPS on each TiDB instance, which is classified according to the success or failure of command execution results
    - Failed Query OPM: the statistics of error types (such as syntax errors and primary key conflicts) according to the errors occurred when executing SQL statements per second on each TiDB instance. It contains the module in which the error occurs and the error code
    - Slow query: the statistics of the processing time of slow queries (the time cost of the entire slow query, the time cost of Coprocessor，and the waiting time for Coprocessor scheduling)
    - 999/99/95/80 Duration: the statistics of the execution time for different types of SQL statements (different percentiles)

- Query Detail
    - Duration 80/95/99/999 By Instance: the statistics of the execution time for SQL statements on each TiDB instance (different percentiles)
    - Failed Query OPM Detail: the statistics of error types (such as syntax errors and primary key conflicts) according to the errors occurred when executing SQL statements on each TiDB instance
    - Internal SQL OPS: the internal SQL statements executed per second in the entire TiDB cluster. The internal SQL statements are internally executed and are generally triggered by user SQL statements or internally scheduled tasks.

- Server
    - Uptime: the runtime of each TiDB instance

    - Keep Alive OPM: the number of times that the metrics are refreshed every minute on each TiDB instance. It usually needs no attention.
    - Prepare Statement Count: the number of `Prepare` statements that are executed on each TiDB instance and the total count of them
    - Time Jump Back OPS: the number of times that the operating system rewinds every second on each TiDB instance

    - Get Token Duration: the time cost of getting Token on each connection

- Transaction
    - Transaction OPS: the number of transactions executed per second
    - Duration: the execution time of a transaction
    - Transaction Statement Num: the number of SQL statements in a transaction
    - Transaction Retry Num: the number of times that a transaction retries
    - Session Retry Error OPS: the number of errors encountered during the transaction retry per second
    - KV Transaction OPS: the number of transactions executed per second within each TiDB instance
        - A user transaction might trigger multiple transaction executions in TiDB, including reading internal metadata, atomic retries of the user transaction, and so on
        - TiDB's internally scheduled tasks also operate on the database through transactions, which are also included in this panel
    - KV Transaction Duration: the time spent on executing transactions within each TiDB
    - Commit Token Wait Duration: the wait duration in the flow control queue during the transaction commit. If the wait duration is long, it means that the transaction to commit is too large and the flow is controlled. If the system still has resources available, you can speed up the commit process by increasing the `committer-concurrency` value in the TiDB configuration file
    - Transaction Max Write KV Num: the maximum number of key-value pairs written by a single transaction
    - Transaction Max Write Size Bytes: the maximum key-value pair size written by a single transaction

    - Send HeartBeat Duration: the interval at which transactions send heartbeats
    - TTL Lifetime Reach Counter: the number of transactions that reach the upper limit of TTL. The default value of the TTL upper limit is 10 minutes. It means that 10 minutes have passed since the first lock of a pessimistic transaction or the first prewrite of an optimistic transaction. The default value of the upper limit of TTL is 10 minutes. The upper limit of TTL life can be changed by modifying `max-txn-TTL` in the TiDB configuration file
    - Statement Lock Keys: the number of locks for a single statement
    - Acquire Pessimistic Locks Duration: the time consumed by adding locks
    - Pessimistic Statement Retry OPS: the number of retry attempts for pessimistic statements. When the statement tries to add lock, it might encounter a write conflict. At this time, the statement will acquire a new snapshot and add lock again
    - Load Safepoint OPS: the number of times that `Safepoint` is loaded. `Safepoint` is to ensure that the data before `Safepoint` is not read when the transaction reads data, thus ensuring data safety. The data before `Safepoint` might be cleaned up by the GC
