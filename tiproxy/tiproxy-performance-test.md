# TiProxy Performance Test Report

This report tests the performance of TiProxy in the OLTP scenario of Sysbench and compares it with [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/).

The results are as follows:

- The QPS upper limit of TiProxy is affected by the type of workload. Under the basic workloads of Sysbench and the same CPU usage, the QPS of TiProxy is about 20% to 40% lower than that of HAProxy.
- The number of TiDB server instances that TiProxy can hold varies according to the type of workload. Under the basic workloads of Sysbench, a TiProxy can hold 4 to 10 TiDB server instances of the same model.
- The performance of TiProxy is more affected by the number of vCPUs, compared to HAProxy. When the returned data is 10,000 rows and the CPU usage is the same, the QPS of TiProxy is about 30% lower than that of HAProxy.
- The performance of TiProxy increases almost linearly with the number of vCPUs. Therefore, increasing the number of vCPUs can effectively improve the QPS upper limit.

### Configuration

#### TiProxy configuration

In the test, TLS is not enabled between the client and TiProxy, or between TiProxy and TiDB server.

```yaml
proxy.conn-buffer-size: 131072
```

#### HAProxy configuration - `haproxy.cfg` file

```yaml
global                                      # Global configuration.
    log         127.0.0.1 local2            # Specifies the global syslog server. You can define up to two.

    nbthread    4                           # The maximum number of threads. The upper limit of the number of threads is the same as the number of CPUs.

    group       haproxy                     # Same as GID parameter. A dedicated user group is recommended.
    daemon                                  # Run HAProxy as a daemon in the background, which is equivalent to the command line parameter "-D". You can also disable it with the "-db" parameter on the command line.

## Basic workload test

### Test plan

This test aims to compare the QPS of TiProxy and HAProxy under four types of workloads: point select, read only, write only, and read write. Each type of workload is tested with different concurrency to compare the QPS of TiProxy and HAProxy.

The following command is used to perform the test:

```bash
sysbench $testname \
    --threads=$threads \
    --time=1200 \
    --report-interval=10 \

## Scalability test

### Test plan

This test aims to verify that the performance of TiProxy is proportional to its specifications, to ensure that upgrading the specifications of TiProxy can improve its QPS upper limit. This test uses TiProxy instances with different vCPU numbers and concurrency to compare the QPS.

The following command is used to perform the test:

```bash
sysbench oltp_point_select \
    --threads=$threads \
    --time=1200 \
