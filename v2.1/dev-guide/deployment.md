# Build for deployment 

## Overview

Note: **The easiest way to deploy TiDB is to use TiDB Ansible, see [Ansible Deployment](../op-guide/ansible-deployment.md).**

Before you start, check the [supported platforms](../dev-guide/requirements.md#supported-platforms) and [prerequisites](../dev-guide/requirements.md#prerequisites) first.

## Building and installing TiDB components

You can use the [build script](../scripts/build.sh) to build and install TiDB components in the `bin` directory.

You can use the [update script](../scripts/update.sh) to update all the TiDB components to the latest version.
