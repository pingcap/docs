## Subtask status

### Status description

- `New`:

    - The initial status.
    - If the subtask does not encounter an error, it is switched to `Running`; otherwise it is switched to `Paused`.

- `Running`: The normal running status.

- `Paused`:

    - The paused status.
    - If the subtask encounters an error, it is switched to `Paused`.
    - If you run `pause-task` when the subtask is in the `Running` status, the task is switched to `Paused`.
    - When the subtask is in this status, you can run the `resume-task` command to resume the task.

- `Stopped`:

    - The stopped status.
    - If you run `stop-task` when the subtask is in the `Running` or `Paused` status, the task is switched to `Stopped`.
    - When the subtask is in this status, you cannot use `resume-task` to resume the task.

- `Finished`:

    - The finished subtask status.
    - Only when the full replication subtask is finished normally, the task is switched to this status.
