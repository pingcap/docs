# Contribution Guide

Please note that there are version folders.
If you are documenting a new change, start in the dev/ folder.

## Linting

PRs have automatic linting from the CI. You can also run markdownlint yourself locally with:

``` bash
./scripts/markdownlint [FILE...]
```

## Designing a figure

To keep a consistent figure style, you are recommended to use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to design a figure.

See [Figma Quick Start Guide](/resources/figma-quick-start-guide.md).
