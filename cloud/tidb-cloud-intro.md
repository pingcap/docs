- TiDB VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

    For each TiDB Cloud cluster, all TiDB nodes and auxiliary nodes, including TiDB Operator nodes, logging nodes, and so on, are deployed in an independent VPC.

- TiDB Cloud Central Services

    Central Services, including billing, alerts, meta storage, dashboard UI, are deployed independently. You can access the dashboard UI to operate the TiDB Cluster cluster via the Internet.

- Your VPC

    You can connect to your TiDB cluster via a VPC peering connection. Refer to [Set up VPC Peering Connection](/cloud/set-up-vpc-peering-connections.md) for details.
