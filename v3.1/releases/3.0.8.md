Release date: December 31, 2019

TiDB version: 3.0.8

TiDB Ansible version: 3.0.8

## TiDB

+ SQL Optimizer
    - Fix the wrong SQL binding plan caused by untimely cache updates [#13891](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13891)
    - Fix the issue that the SQL binding might be invalid when an SQL statement contains a symbol list [#14004](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14004)
    - Fix the issue that an SQL binding cannot be created or deleted because an SQL statement ends with `;` [#14113](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14113)
    - Fix the issue that a wrong SQL query plan might be selected because the `PhysicalUnionScan` operator sets wrong statistics [#14133](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14133)
    - Remove the `minAutoAnalyzeRatio` restriction to make `autoAnalyze` more timely [#14015](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14015)
+ SQL Execution Engine
    - Fix issues that the `INSERT/REPLACE/UPDATE ... SET ... = DEFAULT` syntax might report an error and combining the usage of the `DEFAULT` expression with a virtual generated column might report an error [#13682](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13682)
    - Fix the issue that the `INSERT` statement might report an error when converting a string to a float [#14011](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14011)
    - Fix the issue that sometimes the aggregate operation is low effective because the concurrency value of the `HashAgg` executor is incorrectly initialized [#13811](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13811)
    - Fix the issue that an error is reported in the execution of`group by item` when the clause is in the parentheses [#13658](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13658)
    - Fix the issue that the execution of `OUTER JOIN` might report an error because TiDB incorrectly calculates `group by item` [#14014](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14014)
    - Fix the issue that the error message is inaccurate when Range-exceeding data is written into Range partitioned tables [#14107](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14107)
    - Revert [PR #10124](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/10124) and cancel the `PadCharToFullLength` effect to avoid unexpected query results in special cases, considering that MySQL 8 will discard `PadCharToFullLength` soon [#14157](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14157)
    - Fix the goroutine leak issue when executing the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` statement caused by unguaranteed `close()` calling in `ExplainExec` [#14226](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14226)
+ DDL
    - Optimize the error message output of `change column`/`modify column` to make it easier to understand [#13796](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13796)
    - Add the `SPLIT PARTITION TABLE` syntax to support splitting Regions for partitioned tables [#13929](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13929)
    - Fix the issue that the index length exceeds 3072 bytes and no error is reported because the index length is incorrectly checked when an index is created [#13779](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13779)
    - Fix the issue that the `GC life time is shorter than transaction duration` error message might be reported because it takes too much time to add an index in partitioned tables [#14132](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14132)
    - Fix the panic when `SELECT * FROM information_schema.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE` is executed because the foreign key is not checked when `DROP COLUMN`/`MODIFY COLUMN`/`CHANGE COLUMN` is executed [#14105](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14105)
+ Server
    - Statement Summary improvements:
        - Add a large number of SQL metric fields to facilitate analyzing SQL statements in more detail [#14151](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14151), [#14168](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14168)
        - Add the `stmt-summary.refresh-interval` parameter to control whether to move the stale data from the `events_statements_summary_by_digest` table to the `events_statements_summary_by_digest_history` table (the default interval: 30 minutes) [#14161](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14161)
        - Add the `events_statements_summary_by_digest_history` table to save the stale data in `events_statements_summary_by_digest` [#14166](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14166)

    - Update the privilege required by `GRANT roles TO user` from `GrantPriv` to `ROLE_ADMIN` or `SUPER`, to keep consistency with the MySQL behavior [#13932](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13932)
    - Modify the TiDB behavior from using the current database to reporting the `No database selected` error when the `GRANT` statement does not specify a database name, to keep compatibility with the MySQL behavior [#13784](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13784)
    - Modify the execution privilege for the `REVOKE` statement from `SuperPriv` to `REVOKE` being executable only if the user has the privilege for the corresponding schema, to keep consistency with the MySQL behavior [#13306](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13306)

    - Modify the error code of `ErrInvalidFieldSize` from `1105(Unknow Error)` to `3013` [#13737](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13737)
    - Add the `SHUTDOWN` command to stop a TiDB server and add the `ShutdownPriv` privilege [#14104](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14104)
    - Fix the atomicity issue for the `DROP ROLE` statement to avoid some roles being deleted unexpectedly when TiDB fails to execute a statement [#14130](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14130)
    - Fix the issue that the `tidb_enable_window_function` in the `SHOW VARIABLE` result incorrectly outputs `1` when a TiDB version is upgraded to 3.0, and replace the wrong result with `0` [#14131](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14131)
    - Fix the issue that the goroutine might leak because `gcworker` continuously retries when the TiKV node is offline [#14106](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14106)

+ Raftstore
    - Fix the panic caused by repeatedly sending the `destroy` message to `peerfsm` and `peerfsm` being destroyed multiple times [#6297](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/6297)
