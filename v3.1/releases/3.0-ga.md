# TiDB 3.0 GA Release Notes

Release date: June 28, 2019

TiDB version: 3.0.0

TiDB Ansible version: 3.0.0

## Overview

On June 28, 2019, TiDB 3.0 GA is released. The corresponding TiDB Ansible version is 3.0.0. Compared with TiDB 2.1, this release has greatly improved in the following aspects:

- Stability. TiDB 3.0 has demonstrated long-term stability for large-scale clusters with up to 150+ nodes and 300+ TB of storage.
- Usability. TiDB 3.0 has multi-facet improvements in usability, including standardized slow query logs, well-developed log file specification, and new features such as `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` and SQL Trace to save operation costs for users.
- Performance. The performance of TiDB 3.0 is 4.5 times greater than TiDB 2.1 in TPC-C benchmarks, and over 1.5 times in Sysbench benchmarks. Thanks to the support for Views, TPC-H 50G Q15 can now run normally.
- New features including Window Functions, Views (**Experimental**), partitioned tables, the plugin framework, pessimistic locking (**Experimental**), and `SQL Plan Management`.
