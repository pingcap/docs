## TiDB

- Add more monitoring metrics and refine the log
- Compatible with more MySQL syntax
- Support displaying the table creating time in `information_schema`
- Optimize queries containing the `MaxOneRow` operator

- Add the `tidb_config` session variable to output the current TiDB configuration
- Fix the panic issue in the `Union` and `Index Join` operators
- Fix the wrong result issue of the `Sort Merge Join` operator in some scenarios
- Fix the issue that the `Show Index` statement shows indexes that are in the process of adding
- Fix the failure of the `Drop Stats` statement
- Optimize the query performance of the SQL engine to improve the test result of the Sysbench Select/OLTP by 10%

- Fix the issue that hot spot scheduling violates label constraint
- Fix other stability issues

## TiKV

- Traverse locks using offset + limit to avoid potential GC problems
- Support resolving locks in batches to improve GC speed
- Support GC concurrency to improve GC speed
- Update the Region size using the RocksDB compaction listener for more accurate PD scheduling
- Delete the outdated data in batches using `DeleteFilesInRanges`, to make TiKV start faster
