# TiDB RC4 Release Notes

On August 4, 2017, TiDB RC4 is released! This release is focused on MySQL compatibility, SQL optimization, stability, and performance.

## Highlight

+ For performance, the write performance is improved significantly, and the computing task scheduling supports prioritizing to avoid the impact of OLAP on OLTP.
+ The optimizer is revised for a more accurate query cost estimating and for an automatic choice of the `Join` physical operator based on the cost.
+ Many enhancements have been introduced to be more compatible with MySQL.
+ TiSpark is now released to better support the OLAP business scenarios. You can now use Spark to access the data in TiKV.

## Detailed updates

+ Support `BatchIndexJoin`
+ Improve the `Explain` statement
+ Improve the `Index Scan` performance
+ Many enhancements have been introduced to be more compatible with MySQL
+ Support the JSON type and operations
+ Support the configuration of query prioritizing and isolation level

### Placement Driver (PD)
