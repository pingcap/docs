# Technical Writing Project Ideas

As a small technical writing team, we are dedicated to delivering high quality technical information that is easy to use, easy to understand and easy to find. We are working on it, and your help and support would definitely help!

**Interesting fact:** we call ourselves Content Strategist because user documentation is only one part of our work scope. If you want to know more, let's get in touch at [gsod-tidb@pingcap.com](mailto:gsod-tidb@pingcap.com).

The project ideas of TiDB documentation in Google Season of Docs are as follows:

1. Improve the current [TiDB documentation](https://github.com/pingcap/docs) to make it more user-friendly. This can include reorganizing the content in a single document or within several documents, to make it easier to use and understand.

2. Review GitHub Pull Requests about TiDB documentation. This can include reviewing the language and content organization in docs Pull Requests filed by a contributor, a developer, a Database Administrator, or another Technical Writer.

3. Execute user acceptance tests for TiDB documentation. This can include executing a usability test by following the existing document, such as testing the deployment of TiDB or TiDB ecosystem tools. The tester might find it necessary to update some steps or outdated description or the content structure, and then the documentation can be improved based on this.

4. Take part in refactoring the TiDB documentation for content reuse of Markdown files. Some existing documents that are a bit too long will be split into two or multiple separate documents, to make it easy for content reuse.

5. (Optional) Improve the [Chinese version of TiDB documentation](https://github.com/pingcap/docs-cn) to make it more user-friendly if the Technical Writer is good at both English and Chinese. This can include reorganizing the content in a single document or within several documents, to make it easier to use and understand.
