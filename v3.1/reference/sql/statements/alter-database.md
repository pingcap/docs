# ALTER DATABASE

`ALTER DATABASE` is used to specify or modify the default character set and collation of the current database. `ALTER SCHEMA` has the same effect as `ALTER DATABASE`.

## Examples

```sql
ALTER {DATABASE | SCHEMA} [db_name]
    alter_specification ...
alter_specification:
    [DEFAULT] CHARACTER SET [=] charset_name
  | [DEFAULT] COLLATE [=] collation_name
```

The `alter_specification` option specifies the `CHARACTER SET` and `COLLATE` of a specified database. Currently, TiDB only supports some character sets and collations. See [Character Set Support](/v3.1/reference/sql/character-set.md) for details.
