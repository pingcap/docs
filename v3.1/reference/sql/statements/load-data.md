## Examples

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE trips (
    ->  trip_id bigint NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY auto_increment,
    ->  duration integer not null,
    ->  start_date datetime,
    ->  end_date datetime,
    ->  start_station_number integer,
    ->  start_station varchar(255),
    ->  end_station_number integer,
    ->  end_station varchar(255),
    ->  bike_number varchar(255),
    ->  member_type varchar(255)
    -> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.14 sec)

mysql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '/mnt/evo970/data-sets/bikeshare-data/2017Q4-capitalbikeshare-tripdata.csv' INTO TABLE trips FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '\"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n' IGNORE 1 LINES (duration, start_date, end_date, start_station_number, start_station, end_station_number, end_station, bike_number, member_type);

Query OK, 815264 rows affected (39.63 sec)
Records: 815264  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 0
```

## MySQL compatibility

* TiDB will by default commit every 20 000 rows. This behavior is similar to MySQL NDB Cluster, but not the default configuration with the InnoDB storage engine.

> **Note:**
>
> Committing through splitting a transaction is at the expense of breaking the atomicity and isolation of the transaction. When performing this operation, you must ensure that there are **no other** ongoing operations on the table. When an error occurs, **manual intervention is required to check the consistency and integrity of the data**. Therefore, it is not recommended to set this variable in a production environment.
