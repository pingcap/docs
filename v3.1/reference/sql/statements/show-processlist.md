| Id   | User | Host      | db   | Command | Time | State | Info             |
+------+------+-----------+------+---------+------+-------+------------------+
|    1 | root | 127.0.0.1 | test | Query   |    0 | 2     | SHOW PROCESSLIST |
|    2 | root | 127.0.0.1 |      | Sleep   |    4 | 2     |                  |

## MySQL compatibility

* The `State` column in TiDB is non-descriptive. Representing state as a single value is more complex in TiDB, since queries are executed in parallel and each goroutine will have a different state at any one time.
