# Generated Columns

TiDB supports generated columns as part of MySQL 5.7 compatibility. One of the primary use cases for generated columns is to extract data out of a JSON data type and enable it to be indexed.

## Index JSON using stored generated column

In both MySQL 5.7 and TiDB, columns of type JSON can not be indexed directly. i.e. The following table structure is **not supported**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE person (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address_info JSON,
    KEY (address_info)
);
```

To index a JSON column, you must first extract it as a generated stored column.

> **Note:**
>
> The optimizer in TiDB only uses the index created on a generated stored column. Currently, the optimizer cannot use an index created on a generated virtual column. This issue will be fixed in later TiDB versions (See Issue [#5189](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/5189)).

Using the `city` stored generated column as an example, you are then able to add an index:

```sql
CREATE TABLE person (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address_info JSON,
    city VARCHAR(64) AS (JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT(address_info, '$.city'))) STORED,
    KEY (city)
);
```

In this table, the `city` column is a **generated column**. As the name implies, the column is generated from other columns in the table, and cannot be assigned a value when inserted or updated. This column is generated based on a defined expression and is stored in the database. Thus this column can be read directly, not in a way that its dependent column `address_info` is read first and then the data is calculated. The index on `city` however is _stored_ and uses the same structure as other indexes of the type `varchar(64)`.

You can use the index on the stored generated column in order to speed up the following statement:

```sql
SELECT name, id FROM person WHERE city = 'Beijing';
```

If no data exists at path `$.city`, `JSON_EXTRACT` returns `NULL`. If you want to enforce a constraint that `city` must be `NOT NULL`, you can define the virtual column as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE person (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address_info JSON,
    city VARCHAR(64) AS (JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT(address_info, '$.city'))) STORED NOT NULL,
    KEY (city)
);
```

Both `INSERT` and `UPDATE` statements check virtual column definitions. Rows that do not pass validation return errors:

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO person (name, address_info) VALUES ('Morgan', JSON_OBJECT('Country', 'Canada'));
ERROR 1048 (23000): Column 'city' cannot be null
```

## Use generated virtual columns

TiDB also supports generated virtual columns. Different from generated store columns, generated virtual columns are **virtual** in that they are generated as needed and are not stored in the database or cached in the memory. Although TiDB supports indexing generated virtual columns, the optimizer currently cannot use indexes in this case. This issue will be fixed in a later version of TiDB (Issue [#5189](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/5189)).

```sql
CREATE TABLE person (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address_info JSON,
    city VARCHAR(64) AS (JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT(address_info, '$.city'))) VIRTUAL
);
```

## Limitations

The current limitations of JSON and generated columns are as follows:

- You cannot add the generated column in the storage type of `STORED` through `ALTER TABLE`.
- You cannot create an index on the generated column through `ALTER TABLE`.
- Not all [JSON functions](/v3.1/reference/sql/functions-and-operators/json-functions.md) are supported.
