# Key Monitoring Metrics of PD

If you use Ansible to deploy the TiDB cluster, the monitoring system is deployed at the same time. For more information, see [Overview of the Monitoring Framework](/v3.1/how-to/monitor/overview.md).

The Grafana dashboard is divided into a series of sub dashboards which include Overview, PD, TiDB, TiKV, Node\_exporter, Disk Performance, and so on. A lot of metrics are there to help you diagnose.

You can get an overview of the component PD status from the PD dashboard, where the key metrics are displayed. This document provides a detailed description of these key metrics.

## Key metrics description

To understand the key metrics displayed on the Overview dashboard, check the following table:

Service | Panel name | Description | Normal range
---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------
Cluster | PD role | The role of the current PD |
Cluster | Storage capacity | The total capacity size of the cluster |
Cluster | Current storage size | The current storage size of the cluster |
Cluster | Current storage usage | The total number of Regions without replicas |
Cluster | Normal stores | The count of healthy stores |
Cluster | Abnormal stores | The count of unhealthy stores | The normal value is `0`. If the number is bigger than `0`, it means at least one instance is abnormal.
Cluster | Current peer count | The current peer count of the cluster |

Cluster | pd_cluster_metadata | The metadata of the PD cluster including cluster ID, the timestamp, and the generated ID. |
Cluster | Region health | The health status of Regions indicated via count of unusual Regions including pending peers, down peers, extra peers, offline peers, missing peers, learner peers and incorrect namespaces | The number of pending peers should be less than `100`. The missing peers should not be persistently greater than `0`.
