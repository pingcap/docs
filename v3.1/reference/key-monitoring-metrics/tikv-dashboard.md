# Key Monitoring Metrics of TiKV

If you use Ansible to deploy the TiDB cluster, the monitoring system is deployed at the same time. For more information, see [Overview of the Monitoring Framework](/v3.1/how-to/monitor/overview.md).

The Grafana dashboard is divided into a series of sub dashboards which include Overview, PD, TiDB, TiKV, Node\_exporter, Disk Performance, and so on. A lot of metrics are there to help you diagnose.

You can get an overview of the component TiKV status from the TiKV dashboard, where the key metrics are displayed. This document provides a detailed description of these key metrics.
