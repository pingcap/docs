# TiDB Monitoring Metrics

If you use Ansible to deploy the TiDB cluster, the monitoring system is deployed at the same time. For more information, see [TiDB Monitoring Framework Overview](/v3.1/how-to/monitor/overview.md).

The Grafana dashboard is divided into a series of sub dashboards which include Overview, PD, TiDB, TiKV, Node\_exporter, Disk Performance, and so on. The TiDB dashboard consists of the TiDB panel and the TiDB Summary panel, and what displays on the TiDB Summary panel also displays on the TiDB panel. A lot of metrics are there to help you diagnose.

This document describes some key monitoring metrics displayed on the TiDB dashboard.
