# Mydumper Instructions

## What is Mydumper?

`mydumper` is a fork of the [Mydumper](https://github.com/maxbube/mydumper) project with additional functionality specific to TiDB. It is the recommended method to use for logical backups of TiDB.

It can be [downloaded](/v3.1/reference/tools/download.md) as part of the Enterprise Tools package.

## What enhancements does this contain over regular Mydumper?

+ Uses `tidb_snapshot` to provide backup consistency instead of `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`

+ Allows `tidb_snapshot` to be [configurable](/v3.1/how-to/get-started/read-historical-data.md#how-tidb-reads-data-from-history-versions) (i.e. backup data as it appeared at an earlier point in time)

### New parameter description

```
  -z, --tidb-snapshot: Set the tidb_snapshot to be used for the backup.
                       Default: The current TSO (UniqueID from SHOW MASTER STATUS).
                       Accepts either a TSO or valid datetime.  For example: -z "2016-10-08 16:45:26"
```

### Required privileges

- SELECT
- RELOAD
- LOCK TABLES
- REPLICATION CLIENT

### Usage example

Command line parameter:

```
./bin/mydumper -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -P 4000
```
