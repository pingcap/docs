# Manage the Data Replication Task

This document describes how to manage and maintain the data replication task using the [dmctl](/v3.1/reference/tools/data-migration/overview.md#dmctl) component. For the Data Migration cluster deployed using DM-Ansible, the dmctl binary file is in `dm-ansible/dmctl`.

## dmctl basic usage

This section shows the basic usage of dmctl commands.

### dmctl help

```bash
$ ./dmctl --help
Usage of dmctl:
 # Prints the version information.
 -V prints version and exit
 -config string
       path to config file
 # Encrypts the database password according to the encryption method provided by DM; used in DM configuration files.
 -encrypt string
       encrypt plaintext to ciphertext
 # The DM-master access address. dmctl interacts with the DM-master to complete task management operations.
 -master-addr string
       master API server addr
 -rpc-timeout string
       rpc timeout ("10m" by default)
```

### Database password encryption

In DM configuration files, you need to use the password encrypted using dmctl, otherwise an error occurs. For a same original password, the password is different after each encryption.

```bash
$ ./dmctl -encrypt 123456
VjX8cEeTX+qcvZ3bPaO4h0C80pe/1aU=
```

### Task management overview

```bash
# Enters the command line mode to interact with DM-master.
$ ./dmctl -master-addr 172.16.30.14:8261

## Manage the data replication task

This section describes how to use the task management commands to execute corresponding operations.

### Create the data replication task

You can use the `start-task` command to create the data replication task. Data Migration [prechecks the corresponding privileges and configuration automatically](/v3.1/reference/tools/data-migration/precheck.md) while starting the data replication.

{{< copyable "" >}}

```bash
help start-task
```

```
start a task as defined in the config file

Usage:
 dmctl start-task [-w worker ...] <config-file> [flags]

Flags:
 -h, --help   help for start-task

Global Flags:
 -w, --worker strings   DM-worker ID
```

#### Command usage example

{{< copyable "" >}}

```bash
start-task [ -w "172.16.30.15:8262"] ./task.yaml
```

#### Flags description

- `-w`: (Optional) Specifies the group of DM-workers to execute `task.yaml`. If it is set, only subtasks of the specified task on these DM-workers are started.
- `config-file`: (Required) Specifies the file path of `task.yaml`.

#### Returned results

```bash
{
​    "result": true,
​    "msg": "",
​    "workers": [
​        {
​            "result": true,
​            "worker": "172.16.30.15:8262",
​            "msg": ""
​        },
​        {
​            "result": true,
​            "worker": "172.16.30.16:8262",
​            "msg": ""
​        }
​    ]
}
```

### Check the data replication task status

You can use the `query-status` task management command to check the status of the data replication task. For details about the query result and subtask status, see [Query Status](/v3.1/reference/tools/data-migration/query-status.md).

```bash
help query-status
```

```
query task status

Usage:
 dmctl query-status [-w worker ...] [task-name] [flags]

Flags:
 -h, --help   help for query-status

Global Flags:
 -w, --worker strings   DM-worker ID
```

#### Command usage example

```bash
query-status
```

#### Flags description

- `-w`: (Optional) Specifies the group of DM-workers where the subtasks of the replication task (that you want to query) run.
- `task-name`: (Optional) Specifies the task name. If it is not set, the results of all data replication tasks are returned.

#### Returned results

For detailed description of query parameters and a complete list of returned result, refer to [Query status](/v3.1/reference/tools/data-migration/query-status.md).

### Check query errors

You can use `query-error` to check error information on replication tasks or relay units. Compared to `query-status`, `query-error` only retrieves information related to the error itself.

`query-error` is often used to obtain the binlog position information required by `sql-skip`/`sql-replace`. For details on the flags and results of `query-error`, refer to [`query-error` in Skip or Replace Abnormal SQL Statements](/v3.1/reference/tools/data-migration/skip-replace-sqls.md#query-error).

### Pause the data replication task

You can use the `pause-task` command to pause a data replication task.

{{< copyable "" >}}

```bash
help pause-task
```

```
pause a specified running task

Usage:
 dmctl pause-task [-w worker ...] <task-name> [flags]

Flags:
 -h, --help   help for pause-task

Global Flags:
 -w, --worker strings   DM-worker ID
```

> **Note:**
>
> The differences between `pause-task` and `stop-task` are:
>
> - `pause-task` only pauses a replication task, and the task information is retained in the memory, so that you can query using `query-status`. `stop-task` terminates a replication task and removes all task related information from the memory. This means you cannot use `query-status` to query. Data and the corresponding `dm_meta` like "checkpoint" that have been replicated to the downstream are not affected.
>
> - `pause-task` is generally used to pause the task for troubleshooting, while `stop-task` is used to permanently end a replication task, or co-work with `start-task` to update the configuration information.

#### Command usage example

```bash
pause-task [-w "127.0.0.1:8262"] task-name
```

#### Flags description

- `-w`: (Optional) Specifies the group of DM-workers where the subtasks of the replication task (that you want to pause) run. If it is set, only subtasks on the specified DM-workers are paused.
- `task-name`: (Required) Specifies the task name.

#### Returned results

```bash
pause-task test
```

```
{
​    "op": "Pause",
​    "result": true,
​    "msg": "",
​    "workers": [
​        {
            "meta": {
                "result": true,
                "worker": "172.16.30.15:8262",
                "msg": ""
            },
            "op": "Pause",
            "logID": "2"
​        },

            },
            "op": "Pause",
            "logID": "2"
​        }
​    ]
}
```

### Resume the data replication task

You can use the `resume-task` command to resume the data replication task in the `Paused` state. This is generally used in scenarios where you want to manually resume a data replication task after you handle the errors that cause the task to pause.

```bash
help resume-task
```

```
resume a specified paused task

Usage:
 dmctl resume-task [-w worker ...] <task-name> [flags]

 -h, --help   help for resume-task

Global Flags:
 -w, --worker strings   DM-worker ID
```

#### Command usage example

```bash
resume-task [-w "127.0.0.1:8262"] task-name
```

#### Flags description

- `-w`: (Optional) Specifies the group of DM-workers where the subtasks of the replication task (that you want to restart) run. If it is set, only subtasks on the specified DM-workers are restarted.
- `task-name`: (Required) Specifies the task name.

                 "worker": "172.16.30.15:8262",
                 "msg": ""
             },
             "op": "Resume",
             "logID": "3"
         },
         {
             "meta": {
                 "result": true,
                 "worker": "172.16.30.16:8262",
                 "msg": ""
             },
             "op": "Resume",
             "logID": "3"
         }
     ]
}
```

### Stop the data replication task

You can use the `stop-task` command to stop a data replication task. For differences between `stop-task` and `pause-task`, refer to [Pause the data replication task](#pause-the-data-replication-task).

```bash
help stop-task
```

```
stop a specified task

Usage:
 dmctl stop-task [-w worker ...] <task-name> [flags]

Flags:
 -h, --help   help for stop-task

Global Flags:

```

#### Flags description

- `-w`: (Optional) Specifies the group of DM-workers where the subtasks of the replication task (that you want to stop) run. If it is set, only subtasks on the specified DM-workers are stopped.
- `task-name`: (Required) Specifies the task name.

#### Returned results

```bash
stop-task test
```

```
{
     "op": "Stop",

     "workers": [
         {
             "meta": {
                 "result": true,
                 "worker": "172.16.30.15:8262",
                 "msg": ""
             },
             "op": "Stop",
             "logID": "4"
         },
         {

             "logID": "4"
         }
     ]
}
```

### Update the data replication task

You can use the `update-task` command to update the data replication task. The following items support online update, while all other items do not support online update.

- table route rules
- black white list
- binlog filter rules

> **Note:**
>
> If you can make sure that the relay log required by the replication task will not be removed when the task is stopped, it is recommended that you use [Update items that do not support online update](#update-items-that-do-not-support-online-update) to update task configurations.

#### Update items that support online update

1. Check the status of the corresponding data replication task using `query-status <task-name>`.

    If `stage` is not `Paused`, use `pause-task <task-name>` to pause the task.

2. Edit the `task.yaml` file to update the custom configuration that you need to modify and the incorrect configuration.

3. Update the task configuration using `update-task task.yaml`.

4. Resume the task using `resume-task <task-name>`.

#### Update items that do not support online update

1. Check the status of the corresponding data replication task using `query-status <task-name>`.

    If the task exists, use `stop-task <task-name>` to stop the task.

2. Edit the `task.yaml` file to update the custom configuration that you need to modify and the incorrect configuration.

3. Restart the task using `start-task <task-name>`.

#### Command usage help

```bash
help update-task
```

```
update a task's config for routes, filters, black-white-list

Usage:
  dmctl update-task [-w worker ...] <config-file> [flags]

#### Returned results

```bash
update-task task_all_black.yaml
```

```bash
{
​    "result": true,
​    "msg": "",
​    "workers": [
​        {
​            "result": true,
​            "worker": "172.16.30.15:8262",
​            "msg": ""

​            "msg": ""
​        }
​    ]
}
```

## Manage DDL locks

Currently, DDL lock related commands mainly include `show-ddl-locks`, `unlock-ddl-lock`, `break-ddl-lock`, etc. For more information on their functions, usages, and applicable scenarios, refer to [Handle Sharding DDL Locks Manually](/v3.1/reference/tools/data-migration/features/manually-handling-sharding-ddl-locks.md).

## Other task and cluster management commands

In addition to the common task management commands above, DM also provides some other commands to manage data replication tasks and DM clusters.

### Check the task configuration file

You can use the `check-task` command to check whether a specified configuration file (`task.yaml`) of the replication task is valid, or whether the configuration of upstream/downstream database, permission setting, and schema meet the replication requirements. For more details, refer to [Precheck the upstream MySQL instance configuration](/v3.1/reference/tools/data-migration/precheck.md).

When you use `start-task` to start a replication task, DM also executes all checks done by `check-task`.

{{< copyable "" >}}

```bash
help check-task
```

```
check the config file of the task

Usage:
 dmctl check-task <config-file> [flags]

Flags:
 -h, --help   help for check-task

Global Flags:
 -w, --worker strings   DM-worker ID
```

#### Command usage example

{{< copyable "" >}}

```bash
check-task task.yaml
```

#### Flags description

+ `config-file`: (Required) Specifies the path of the `task.yaml` file

#### Returned results

{{< copyable "" >}}

```bash
check-task task-test.yaml
```

```
{
    "result": true,
    "msg": "check pass!!!"
}
```

### Pause a relay unit

Relay units automatically run after the DM-worker thread starts. You can use the `pause-relay` command to pause the running relay units.

When you want to switch the DM-worker to connect to an upstream MySQL via a virtual IP, use `pause-relay` to make corresponding changes on DM.

{{< copyable "" >}}

```bash
help pause-relay
```

```
pause DM-worker's relay unit

Usage:
  dmctl pause-relay <-w worker ...> [flags]

        }
    ]
}
```

### Switch the sub-directory for relay logs

Relay units store the binlog data from upstream MySQL instances in sub-directories. You can use the `switch-relay-master` command to swith the relay unit to use a new sub-directory.

When you want to switch the DM-worker to connect to an upstream MySQL via a virtual IP, use `switch-relay-master` to make corresponding changes on DM.

{{< copyable "" >}}

```bash
help switch-relay-master

            "msg": ""
        }
    ]
}
```

### Manually purge relay log

DM supports [Automatic data purge](/v3.1/reference/tools/data-migration/relay-log.md#automatic-data-purge). You can also use `purge-relay` to [manually purge data](/v3.1/reference/tools/data-migration/relay-log.md#manual-data-purge).

{{< copyable "" >}}

```bash
help purge-relay
```

```

{
    "result": true,
    "msg": "",
    "workers": [
        {
            "result": true,
            "worker": "127.0.0.1:8262",
            "msg": ""
        }
    ]
}
```

### Preset skip operation

You can use `sql-skip` to preset a skip operation to be executed when the position or the SQL statement of the binlog event matches with the specified `binlog-pos` or `sql-pattern`. For descriptions of related parameters and results, refer to [`sql-skip`](/v3.1/reference/tools/data-migration/skip-replace-sqls.md#sql-skip).

### Preset replace operation

You can use `sql-replace` to preset a replace operation to be executed when the position or the SQL statement of the binlog event matches with the specified `binlog-pos` or `sql-pattern`. For descriptions of related parameters and results, refer to [`sql-replace`](/v3.1/reference/tools/data-migration/skip-replace-sqls.md#sql-replace).

### Forcefully refresh the `task => DM-workers` mapping

You can use the `refresh-worker-tasks` command to forcefully refresh the `task => DM-workers` mapping cached in the memory of the DM-master.

> **Note:**
>
> Normally it is not necessary to use this command. Use it only when the `task => DM-workers` already exists and you are prompted to refresh it when executing other commands.

## Refresh worker tasks

You can use the `refresh-worker-tasks` command to forcefully refresh the `task => DM-workers` mapping maintained in the DM-master memory.
