# Install TiDB data migration tools

This document describes how to install data migration tools. Since TiDB 4.0, TiUP serves as the package manager to help you easily manage different cluster components in the TiDB ecosystem. Now you can manage any components with only one single TiUP command line.

## Prerequisites

- [Hardware and software requirements](/hardware-and-software-requirements.md)
- [Environment and system configuration check](/check-before-deployment.md)

## Step 1. Install TiUP

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://tiup-mirrors.pingcap.com/install.sh | sh
```

Redeclare the global environment variables:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
source ~/.bash_profile
```

## Step 2. Install Components

You can start by listing all the components:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
tiup list
```

You can see the following output:

```bash
Available components:
Name            Owner    Description
----            -----    -----------
bench           pingcap  Benchmark database with different workloads
br              pingcap  TiDB/TiKV cluster backup restore tool

dm              pingcap  Data Migration Platform manager
dmctl           pingcap  dmctl component of Data Migration Platform

tiup            pingcap  TiUP is a command-line component management tool that can help to download and install TiDB platform components to the local system
```

Then, select necessary components to install:

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
tiup install dumpling tidb-lightning
```

> **Note:**
>
> To install a component of a specific version, you can use the `tiup install <component>[:version]` command.

## Step 3. Update TiUP and components (Optional)

It is recommended that you check the release notes and pay attention to compatibility changes.

{{< copyable "shell-regular" >}}

```shell
tiup update --self && tiup update dm
```
