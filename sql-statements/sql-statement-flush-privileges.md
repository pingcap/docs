# FLUSH PRIVILEGES

This statement triggers TiDB to reload the in-memory copy of privileges from the privilege tables. You should execute `FLUSH PRIVILEGES` after making manual edits to tables such as `mysql.user`. Executing this statement is not required after using privilege statements such as `GRANT` or `REVOKE`. Executing this statement requires the `RELOAD` privilege.
