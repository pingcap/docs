# BACKUP

This statement is used to perform a distributed backup of the TiDB cluster.

> **Warning:**
>
> - This feature is experimental. It is not recommended that you use it in the production environment. This feature might be changed or removed without prior notice. If you find a bug, you can report an [issue](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues) on GitHub.
> - This feature is not available on [TiDB Serverless](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/select-cluster-tier#tidb-serverless) clusters.

The `BACKUP` statement uses the same engine as the [BR tool](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/backup-and-restore-overview) does, except that the backup process is driven by TiDB itself rather than a separate BR tool. All benefits and warnings of BR also apply to this statement.

Executing `BACKUP` requires either the `BACKUP_ADMIN` or `SUPER` privilege. Additionally, both the TiDB node executing the backup and all TiKV nodes in the cluster must have read or write permission to the destination. Local storage (storage paths starting with `local://`) is not permitted when [Security Enhanced Mode](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_enhanced_security) is enabled.

The `BACKUP` statement is blocked until the entire backup task is finished, failed, or canceled. A long-lasting connection should be prepared for executing `BACKUP`. The task can be canceled using the [`KILL TIDB QUERY`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-kill.md) statement.

Only one `BACKUP` and [`RESTORE`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-restore.md) task can be executed at a time. If a `BACKUP` or `RESTORE` statement is already being executed on the same TiDB server, the new `BACKUP` execution will wait until all previous tasks are finished.

`BACKUP` can only be used with "tikv" storage engine. Using `BACKUP` with the "unistore" engine will fail.

## Synopsis

```ebnf+diagram
BackupStmt ::=
    "BACKUP" BRIETables "TO" stringLit BackupOption*

BRIETables ::=
    "DATABASE" ( '*' | DBName (',' DBName)* )
|   "TABLE" TableNameList

BackupOption ::=
    "RATE_LIMIT" '='? LengthNum "MB" '/' "SECOND"
|   "CONCURRENCY" '='? LengthNum
|   "CHECKSUM" '='? Boolean
|   "SEND_CREDENTIALS_TO_TIKV" '='? Boolean
|   "LAST_BACKUP" '='? BackupTSO
|   "SNAPSHOT" '='? ( BackupTSO | LengthNum TimestampUnit "AGO" )

Boolean ::=
    NUM | "TRUE" | "FALSE"

BackupTSO ::=
    LengthNum | stringLit
```

## Examples

### Back up databases

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
BACKUP DATABASE `test` TO 'local:///mnt/backup/2020/04/';
```

```sql
+------------------------------+-----------+-----------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| Destination                  | Size      | BackupTS        | Queue Time          | Execution Time      |
+------------------------------+-----------+-----------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| local:///mnt/backup/2020/04/ | 248665063 | 416099531454472 | 2020-04-12 23:09:48 | 2020-04-12 23:09:48 |
+------------------------------+-----------+-----------------+---------------------+---------------------+
1 row in set (58.453 sec)
```

In the example above, the `test` database is backed up into the local filesystem. The data is saved as SST files in the `/mnt/backup/2020/04/` directories distributed among all TiDB and TiKV nodes.

The first row of the result above is described as follows:

| Column | Description |
| :-------- | :--------- |
| `Destination` | The destination URL |
| `Size` |  The total size of the backup archive, in bytes |
| `BackupTS` | The TSO of the snapshot when the backup is created (useful for [incremental backup](#incremental-backup)) |
| `Queue Time` | The timestamp (in current time zone) when the `BACKUP` task is queued. |
| `Execution Time` | The timestamp (in current time zone) when the `BACKUP` task starts to run. |

### Back up tables

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
BACKUP TABLE `test`.`sbtest01` TO 'local:///mnt/backup/sbtest01/';
```

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
BACKUP TABLE sbtest02, sbtest03, sbtest04 TO 'local:///mnt/backup/sbtest/';
```

### Back up the entire cluster

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
BACKUP DATABASE * TO 'local:///mnt/backup/full/';
```

Note that the system tables (`mysql.*`, `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.*`, `PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA.*`, â€¦) will not be included into the backup.

### External storages

BR supports backing up data to S3 or GCS:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
BACKUP DATABASE `test` TO 's3://example-bucket-2020/backup-05/?access-key={YOUR_ACCESS_KEY}&secret-access-key={YOUR_SECRET_KEY}';
```

<CustomContent platform="tidb">

The URL syntax is further explained in [URI Formats of External Storage Services](/external-storage-uri.md).

</CustomContent>

<CustomContent platform="tidb-cloud">

The URL syntax is further explained in [external storage URI](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/external-storage-uri).

</CustomContent>

When running on cloud environment where credentials should not be distributed, set the `SEND_CREDENTIALS_TO_TIKV` option to `FALSE`:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
BACKUP DATABASE `test` TO 's3://example-bucket-2020/backup-05/'
    SEND_CREDENTIALS_TO_TIKV = FALSE;
```

### Performance fine-tuning

Use `RATE_LIMIT` to limit the average upload speed per TiKV node to reduce network bandwidth.

Before the backup is completed, `BACKUP` would perform a checksum against the data on the cluster to verify correctness. If you are confident that this verification is unnecessary, you can disable the check by setting the `CHECKSUM` parameter to `FALSE`.

To specify the number of concurrent tasks that BR can execute for backing up tables and indices, use the `CONCURRENCY` parameter. This parameter controls the thread pool size within BR, optimizing the performance and efficiency of backup operations.

One task represents one table range or one index range, according to the backup schemas. For one table with one index, two tasks are used to back up this table. The default value of `CONCURRENCY` is `4`. If you need to back up lots of tables or indices, increase its value.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
BACKUP DATABASE `test` TO 's3://example-bucket-2020/backup-06/'
    RATE_LIMIT = 120 MB/SECOND
    CONCURRENCY = 8
    CHECKSUM = FALSE;
```

### Snapshot

Specify a timestamp, TSO or relative time to backup historical data.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
-- relative time
BACKUP DATABASE `test` TO 'local:///mnt/backup/hist01'
    SNAPSHOT = 36 HOUR AGO;

-- timestamp (in current time zone)
BACKUP DATABASE `test` TO 'local:///mnt/backup/hist02'
    SNAPSHOT = '2020-04-01 12:00:00';

-- timestamp oracle
BACKUP DATABASE `test` TO 'local:///mnt/backup/hist03'
    SNAPSHOT = 415685305958400;
```

The supported units for relative time are:

* MICROSECOND
* SECOND
* MINUTE
* HOUR
* DAY
* WEEK

Note that, following SQL standard, the units are always singular.

### Incremental backup

Supply the `LAST_BACKUP` option to only backup the changes between the last backup to the current snapshot.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
-- timestamp (in current time zone)
BACKUP DATABASE `test` TO 'local:///mnt/backup/hist02'
    LAST_BACKUP = '2020-04-01 12:00:00';

-- timestamp oracle
BACKUP DATABASE `test` TO 'local:///mnt/backup/hist03'
    LAST_BACKUP = 415685305958400;
```
