# ADMIN RESUME DDL JOBS

`ADMIN RESUME DDL` allows you to resume a paused DDL job. You can find the `job_id` by running [`ADMIN SHOW DDL JOBS`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-admin-show-ddl.md).

You can use this statement to resume a paused DDL job. After the resume is completed, the SQL statement that executes the DDL job continues to show as being executed. If you try to resume a DDL job that has already been completed, you will see the `DDL Job:90 not found` error in the `RESULT` column, which indicates that the job has been removed from the DDL waiting queue.

## Synopsis

```ebnf+diagram
AdminResumeDDLStmt ::=
    'ADMIN' 'RESUME' 'DDL' 'JOBS' NumList 

NumList ::=
    Int64Num ( ',' Int64Num )*
```

## Examples

`ADMIN RESUME DDL JOBS` resumes the currently paused DDL job and returns whether the job is resumed successfully.

```sql
ADMIN RESUME DDL JOBS job_id [, job_id] ...;
```

If the resume fails, the specific reason for the failure is displayed.
