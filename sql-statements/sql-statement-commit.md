# COMMIT

This statement commits a transaction inside of the TIDB server.

In the absence of a `BEGIN` or `START TRANSACTION` statement, the default behavior of TiDB is that every statement will be its own transaction and autocommit. This behavior ensures MySQL compatibility.

## Synopsis

```ebnf+diagram
CommitStmt ::=
    'COMMIT' CompletionTypeWithinTransaction?

CompletionTypeWithinTransaction ::=
    'AND' ( 'CHAIN' ( 'NO' 'RELEASE' )? | 'NO' 'CHAIN' ( 'NO'? 'RELEASE' )? )
|   'NO'? 'RELEASE'
```

## Examples

```sql
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (a int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)

mysql> START TRANSACTION;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> COMMIT;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

## MySQL compatibility

* Currently, TiDB does not use Metadata Locking (MDL) to prevent DDL statements from modifying tables used by transactions. If the definition of a table has changed, committing a transaction will result in an `Information schema is changed` error. In this event, the transaction is rolled back automatically.
* By default, TiDB 3.0.8 and later versions use [Pessimistic Locking](/pessimistic-transaction.md). When using [Optimistic Locking](/optimistic-transaction.md), it is important to consider that a `COMMIT` statement might fail because rows have been modified by another transaction.
* When Optimistic Locking is enabled, `UNIQUE` and `PRIMARY KEY` constraint checks are deferred until statement commit. This results in additional situations where a a `COMMIT` statement might fail. This behavior can be changed by setting `tidb_constraint_check_in_place=TRUE`.
* TiDB parses but ignores the syntax `ROLLBACK AND [NO] RELEASE`. This functionality is used in MySQL to disconnect the client session immediately after committing the transaction. In TiDB, it is recommended to instead use the `mysql_close()` functionality of your client driver.
* TiDB parses but ignores the syntax `ROLLBACK AND [NO] CHAIN`. This functionality is used in MySQL to immediately start a new transaction with the same isolation level while the current transaction is being committed. In TiDB, it is recommended to instead start a new transaction.
