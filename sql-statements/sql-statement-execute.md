# EXECUTE

The `EXECUTE` statement provides an SQL interface to server-side prepared statements.

## Synopsis

```ebnf+diagram
ExecuteStmt ::=
    'EXECUTE' Identifier ( 'USING' UserVariable ( ',' UserVariable )* )?
```

## Examples

```sql
mysql> PREPARE mystmt FROM 'SELECT ? as num FROM DUAL';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SET @number = 5;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> EXECUTE mystmt USING @number;
+------+
| num  |
+------+
| 5    |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> DEALLOCATE PREPARE mystmt;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```
