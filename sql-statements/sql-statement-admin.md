- [`ADMIN RELOAD`](#admin-reload-statement)
- [`ADMIN PLUGINS`](#admin-plugins-related-statement)
- [`ADMIN ... BINDINGS`](#admin-bindings-related-statement)
- [`ADMIN REPAIR`](#admin-repair-statement)

## `ADMIN RELOAD` statement

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
ADMIN RELOAD expr_pushdown_blacklist;
```

The above statement is used to reload the blocklist pushed down by the expression.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
ADMIN RELOAD opt_rule_blacklist;
```

The above statement is used to reload the blocklist of logic optimization rules.

## `ADMIN PLUGINS` related statement

> **Note:**
>
> This feature is not available on [TiDB Serverless](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/select-cluster-tier#tidb-serverless) clusters.

```sql
ADMIN PLUGINS ENABLE plugin_name [, plugin_name] ...;
```

The above statement is used to enable the `plugin_name` plugin.

```sql
ADMIN PLUGINS DISABLE plugin_name [, plugin_name] ...;
```

The above statement is used to disable the `plugin_name` plugin.

## `ADMIN BINDINGS` related statement

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
ADMIN FLUSH BINDINGS;
```

The above statement is used to persist SQL Plan binding information.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
ADMIN CAPTURE BINDINGS;
```

The above statement can generate the binding of SQL Plan from the `SELECT` statement that occurs more than once.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
ADMIN EVOLVE BINDINGS;
```

After the automatic binding feature is enabled, the evolution of SQL Plan binding information is triggered every `bind-info-leave` (the default value is `3s`). The above statement is used to proactively trigger this evolution.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
ADMIN RELOAD BINDINGS;
```

The above statement is used to reload SQL Plan binding information.

## `ADMIN REPAIR` statement

<CustomContent platform="tidb-cloud">

> **Note:**
>
> This TiDB statement is not applicable to TiDB Cloud.

</CustomContent>

To overwrite the metadata of the stored table in an untrusted way in extreme cases, use `ADMIN REPAIR TABLE`:

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
ADMIN REPAIR TABLE tbl_name CREATE TABLE STATEMENT;
```

<CustomContent platform="tidb">

Here "untrusted" means that you need to manually ensure that the metadata of the original table can be covered by the `CREATE TABLE STATEMENT` operation. To use this `REPAIR` statement, enable the [`repair-mode`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#repair-mode) configuration item, and make sure that the tables to be repaired are listed in the [`repair-table-list`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#repair-table-list).

</CustomContent>

## `ADMIN SHOW NEXT_ROW_ID` statement

```sql
ADMIN SHOW t NEXT_ROW_ID;
```

The above statement is used to view the details of some special columns of a table. The output is the same as [SHOW TABLE NEXT_ROW_ID](/sql-statements/sql-statement-show-table-next-rowid.md).

## `ADMIN SHOW SLOW` statement

> **Note:**
>
> This feature is not available on [TiDB Serverless](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/select-cluster-tier#tidb-serverless) clusters.

```sql
ADMIN SHOW SLOW RECENT N;
```

```sql
ADMIN SHOW SLOW TOP [INTERNAL | ALL] N;
```

<CustomContent platform="tidb">

For details, refer to [`ADMIN SHOW SLOW` command](/identify-slow-queries.md#admin-show-slow-command).

</CustomContent>

## Examples

Run the following command to view the last 10 completed DDL jobs in the currently running DDL job queue. When `NUM` is not specified, only the last 10 completed DDL jobs is presented by default.

{{< copyable "sql" >}}

```sql
ADMIN SHOW DDL JOBS;
```

```

* `JOB_ID`: each DDL operation corresponds to one DDL job. `JOB_ID` is globally unique.
* `DB_NAME`: the name of the database on which the DDL operations are performed.
* `TABLE_NAME`: the name of the table on which the DDL operations are performed.
* `JOB_TYPE`: the type of the DDL operations.
* `SCHEMA_STATE`: the current state of the schema. If the `JOB_TYPE` is `add index`, it is the state of the index; if the `JOB_TYPE` is `add column`, it is the state of the column; if the `JOB_TYPE` is `create table`, it is the state of the table. The common states include:
    * `none`: it indicates not existing. When the `drop` or `create` operation fails and rolls back, it usually becomes the `none` state.
    * `delete only`, `write only`, `delete reorganization`, `write reorganization`: these four states are intermediate states. These states are not visible in common operations, because the conversion from the intermediate states is so quick. You can see the `write reorganization` state only in `add index` operations, which means that the index data is being added.
    * `public`: it indicates existing and usable. When operations like `create table` and `add index/column` are finished, it usually becomes the `public` state, which means that the created table/column/index can be normally read and written now.
* `SCHEMA_ID`: the ID of the database on which the DDL operations are performed.
* `TABLE_ID`: the ID of the table on which the DDL operations are performed.
* `ROW_COUNT`: the number of the data rows that have been added when running the `add index` operation.
* `START_TIME`: the start time of the DDL operations.
* `END_TIME`: the end time of the DDL operations.
* `STATE`: the state of the DDL operations. The common states include:
    * `none`: it indicates that the operation task has been put in the DDL job queue but has not been performed yet, because it is waiting for the previous tasks to complete. Another reason might be that it becomes the `none` state after running the drop operation, but it will soon be updated to the `synced` state, which means that all TiDB instances have been synced to this state.
    * `running`: it indicates that the operation is being performed.
    * `synced`: it indicates that the operation has been performed successfully and all TiDB instances have been synced to this state.
    * `rollback done`: it indicates that the operation has failed and has finished rolling back.
    * `rollingback`: it indicates that the operation has failed and is rolling back.
    * `cancelling`: it indicates that the operation is being cancelled. This state only occurs when you cancel DDL jobs using the [`ADMIN CANCEL DDL JOBS`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-admin-cancel-ddl.md) command.
    * `paused`: it indicates that the operation has been paused. This state only appears when you use the [`ADMIN PAUSED DDL JOBS`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-admin-pause-ddl.md) command to pause the DDL job. You can use the [`ADMIN RESUME DDL JOBS`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-admin-resume-ddl.md) command to resume the DDL job.

## MySQL compatibility

This statement is a TiDB extension to MySQL syntax.
