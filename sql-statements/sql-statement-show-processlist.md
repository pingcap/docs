# SHOW [FULL] PROCESSLIST

This statement lists the current sessions connected to the same TiDB server. The `Info` column contains the query text, which will be truncated unless the optional keyword `FULL` is specified.

```sql
mysql> SHOW PROCESSLIST;
+------+------+-----------+------+---------+------+-------+------------------+
| Id   | User | Host      | db   | Command | Time | State | Info             |
+------+------+-----------+------+---------+------+-------+------------------+
|    1 | root | 127.0.0.1 | test | Query   |    0 | 2     | SHOW PROCESSLIST |
|    2 | root | 127.0.0.1 |      | Sleep   |    4 | 2     |                  |
+------+------+-----------+------+---------+------+-------+------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

## MySQL compatibility

* The `State` column in TiDB is non-descriptive. Representing state as a single value is more complex in TiDB, since queries are executed in parallel and each goroutine will have a different state at any one time.
