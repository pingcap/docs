We are dedicated to delivering high quality technical information that is easy to use, easy to understand and easy to find. We are working on it, and your help and support would definitely help!

**Interesting fact:** We call ourselves Content Strategist because user documentation is only one part of our work scope. If you want to know more, let's get in touch at [gsod-tidb@pingcap.com](mailto:gsod-tidb@pingcap.com).

## Project ideas

This section describes the project ideas of [TiDB documentation](https://pingcap.com/docs) in Google Season of Docs.

### Project name

TiDB 4.0 Documentation Improvement

### Project description

1. Improve the current [TiDB 4.0 documentation](https://pingcap.com/docs/v4.0/) to make it more user-friendly. This can include reorganizing the content in a single document or within several documents, to make it easier to use and understand.

2. Execute user acceptance tests for TiDB 4.0 how-to guides and tutorials. For example, a technical writer can test a deployment guide's usability by following the instructions step by step and see whether anything needs to be improved (such as updating unclear or outdated descriptions, adding missing steps or necessary information, or refining the content structure). Then, they can file Pull Requests to improve the documentation based on tests.

3. Review [GitHub Pull Requests about TiDB 4.0 documentation](https://github.com/pingcap/docs/pulls). This can include reviewing the language and content organization in docs Pull Requests filed by a contributor, a developer, a Database Administrator, or another Technical Writer.
