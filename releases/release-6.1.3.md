# TiDB 6.1.3 Release Notes

Release date: December 5, 2022

TiDB version: 6.1.3

Quick access: [Quick start](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.1/quick-start-with-tidb) | [Production deployment](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.1/production-deployment-using-tiup) | [Installation packages](https://www.pingcap.com/download/?version=v6.1.3#version-list)

## Compatibility changes

- Tools

    - TiCDC

        - Change the default value of [`transaction-atomicity`](/ticdc/ticdc-sink-to-mysql.md#configure-sink-uri-for-mysql-or-tidb) from `table` to `none`, which helps reduce replication latency and reduce OOM risks, and ensures that only a few transactions (the size of a single transaction exceeds 1024 rows) are split, instead of all transactions [#7505](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/7505) [#5231](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/5231) @[asddongmen](https://github.com/asddongmen)

## Improvements

- PD

    - Optimize the granularity of locks to reduce lock contention and improve the capability of processing heartbeat in high concurrency [#5586](https://github.com/tikv/pd/issues/5586) @[rleungx](https://github.com/rleungx)

- Tools

    - TiCDC

        - Enable transaction split and disable the safe mode of a changefeed in TiCDC by default to improve performance [#7505](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/7505) @[asddongmen](https://github.com/asddongmen)
        - Improve the performance of Kafka protocol encoder [#7540](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/7540), [#7532](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/7532), [#7543](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/7543) @[sdojjy](https://github.com/sdojjy) @[3AceShowHand](https://github.com/3AceShowHand)

- Others

    - Upgrade the Go compiler version of TiDB from go1.18 to [go1.19](https://go.dev/doc/go1.19), which improves the TiDB stability. Specifically, a Go environment variable [`GOMEMLIMIT`](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime@go1.19#hdr-Environment_Variables) is introduced to keep the memory usage of TiDB below a certain threshold. This helps mitigate most OOM issues. For more information, see [Mitigate OOM issues by configuring the `GOMEMLIMIT`](/configure-memory-usage.md#mitigate-oom-issues-by-configuring-gomemlimit).
