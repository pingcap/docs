## Feature details

### Performance

* Enhance the Partitioned Raft KV storage engine (experimental) [#11515](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/11515) [#12842](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/12842) @[busyjay](https://github.com/busyjay) @[tonyxuqqi](https://github.com/tonyxuqqi) @[tabokie](https://github.com/tabokie) @[bufferflies](https://github.com/bufferflies) @[5kbpers](https://github.com/5kbpers) @[SpadeA-Tang](https://github.com/SpadeA-Tang) @[nolouch](https://github.com/nolouch)

    TiDB v6.6.0 introduces the Partitioned Raft KV storage engine as an experimental feature, which uses multiple RocksDB instances to store TiKV Region data, and the data of each Region is independently stored in a separate RocksDB instance. The new storage engine can better control the number and level of files in the RocksDB instance, achieve physical isolation of data operations between Regions, and support stably managing more data. Compared with the original TiKV storage engine, using the Partitioned Raft KV storage engine can achieve about twice the write throughput and reduce the elastic scaling time by about 4/5 under the same hardware conditions and mixed read and write scenarios.

    In TiDB v7.1.0, the Partitioned Raft KV storage engine supports tools such as TiDB Lightning, BR, and TiCDC.

    Currently, this feature is experimental and not recommended for use in production environments. You can only use this engine in a newly created cluster and you cannot directly upgrade from the original TiKV storage engine.

    For more information, see [documentation](/partitioned-raft-kv.md).

* TiFlash supports late materialization (GA) [#5829](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/5829) @[Lloyd-Pottiger](https://github.com/Lloyd-Pottiger)

    In v7.0.0, late materialization was introduced in TiFlash as an experimental feature for optimizing query performance. This feature is disabled by default (the [`tidb_opt_enable_late_materialization`](/system-variables.md#tidb_opt_enable_late_materialization-new-in-v700) system variable defaults to `OFF`). When processing a `SELECT` statement with filter conditions (`WHERE` clause), TiFlash reads all the data from the columns required by the query, and then filters and aggregates the data based on the query conditions. When Late materialization is enabled, TiDB supports pushing down part of the filter conditions to the TableScan operator. That is, TiFlash first scans the column data related to the filter conditions that are pushed down to the TableScan operator, filters the rows that meet the condition, and then scans the other column data of these rows for further calculation, thereby reducing IO scans and computations of data processing.

    Starting from v7.1.0, the TiFlash late materialization feature is generally available and enabled by default (the [`tidb_opt_enable_late_materialization`](/system-variables.md#tidb_opt_enable_late_materialization-new-in-v700) system variable defaults to `ON`). The TiDB optimizer decides which filters to be pushed down to the TableScan operator based on the statistics and the filter conditions of the query.

    For more information, see [documentation](/tiflash/tiflash-late-materialization.md).

* TiFlash supports automatically choosing an MPP Join algorithm according to the overhead of network transmission [#7084](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/7084) @[solotzg](https://github.com/solotzg)

    The TiFlash MPP mode supports multiple Join algorithms. Before v7.1.0, TiDB determines whether the MPP mode uses the Broadcast Hash Join algorithm based on the [`tidb_broadcast_join_threshold_count`](/system-variables.md#tidb_broadcast_join_threshold_count-new-in-v50) and [`tidb_broadcast_join_threshold_size`](/system-variables.md#tidb_broadcast_join_threshold_size-new-in-v50) variables and the actual data volume.

    In v7.1.0, TiDB introduces the [`tidb_prefer_broadcast_join_by_exchange_data_size`](/system-variables.md#tidb_prefer_broadcast_join_by_exchange_data_size-new-in-v710) variable, which controls whether to choose the MPP Join algorithm based on the minimum overhead of network transmission. This variable is disabled by default, indicating that the default algorithm selection method remains the same as that before v7.1.0. You can set the variable to `ON` to enable it. When it is enabled, you no longer need to manually adjust the [`tidb_broadcast_join_threshold_count`](/system-variables.md#tidb_broadcast_join_threshold_count-new-in-v50) and [`tidb_broadcast_join_threshold_size`](/system-variables.md#tidb_broadcast_join_threshold_size-new-in-v50) variables (both variables does not take effect at this time), TiDB automatically estimates the threshold of network transmission by different Join algorithms, and then chooses the algorithm with the smallest overhead overall, thus reducing network traffic and improving MPP query performance.

    For more information, see [documentation](/tiflash/use-tiflash-mpp-mode.md#algorithm-support-for-the-mpp-mode).

* Support load-based replica read to mitigate read hotspots [#14151](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/14151) @[sticnarf](https://github.com/sticnarf) @[you06](https://github.com/you06)

    In a read hotspot scenario, the hotspot TiKV node cannot process read requests in time, resulting in the read requests queuing. However, not all TiKV resources are exhausted at this time. To reduce latency, TiDB v7.1.0 introduces the load-based replica read feature, which allows TiDB to read data from other TiKV nodes without queuing on the hotspot TiKV node. You can control the queue length of read requests using the [`tidb_load_based_replica_read_threshold`](/system-variables.md#tidb_load_based_replica_read_threshold-new-in-v700) system variable. When the estimated queue time of the leader node exceeds this threshold, TiDB prioritizes reading data from follower nodes. This feature can improve read throughput by 70% to 200% in a read hotspot scenario compared to not scattering read hotspots.

    For more information, see [documentation](/troubleshoot-hot-spot-issues.md#scatter-read-hotspots).

* Enhance the capability of caching execution plans for non-prepared statements (experimental) [#36598](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/36598) @[qw4990](https://github.com/qw4990)

    TiDB v7.0.0 introduces non-prepared plan cache as an experimental feature to improve the load capacity of concurrent OLTP. In v7.1.0, TiDB enhances this feature and supports caching more SQL statements.

    To improve memory utilization, TiDB v7.1.0 merges the cache pools of non-prepared and prepared plan caches. You can control the cache size using the system variable [`tidb_session_plan_cache_size`](/system-variables.md#tidb_session_plan_cache_size-new-in-v710). The [`tidb_prepared_plan_cache_size`](/system-variables.md#tidb_prepared_plan_cache_size-new-in-v610) and [`tidb_non_prepared_plan_cache_size`](/system-variables.md#tidb_non_prepared_plan_cache_size) system variables are deprecated.

    To maintain forward compatibility, when you upgrade from an earlier version to v7.1.0 or later versions, the cache size `tidb_session_plan_cache_size` remains the same value as `tidb_prepared_plan_cache_size`, and [`tidb_enable_non_prepared_plan_cache`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_non_prepared_plan_cache) remains the setting before the upgrade. After sufficient performance testing, you can enable non-prepared plan cache using `tidb_enable_non_prepared_plan_cache`. For a newly created cluster, non-prepared plan cache is enabled by default.

    Non-prepared plan cache does not support DML statements by default. To remove this restriction, you can set the [`tidb_enable_non_prepared_plan_cache_for_dml`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_non_prepared_plan_cache_for_dml-new-in-v710) system variable to `ON`.

    For more information, see [documentation](/sql-non-prepared-plan-cache.md).

* Support the TiDB Distributed eXecution Framework (DXF) (experimental) [#41495](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/41495) @[benjamin2037](https://github.com/benjamin2037)

    Before TiDB v7.1.0, only one TiDB node can serve as the DDL owner and execute DDL tasks at the same time. Starting from TiDB v7.1.0, in the new DXF, multiple TiDB nodes can execute the same DDL task in parallel, thus better utilizing the resources of the TiDB cluster and significantly improving the performance of DDL. In addition, you can linearly improve the performance of DDL by adding more TiDB nodes. Note that this feature is currently experimental and only supports `ADD INDEX` operations.

    To use the DXF, set the value of [`tidb_enable_dist_task`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_dist_task-new-in-v710) to `ON`:

    ```sql
    SET GLOBAL tidb_enable_dist_task = ON;
    ```

    For more information, see [documentation](/tidb-distributed-execution-framework.md).

### Reliability

* Resource Control becomes generally available (GA) [#38825](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/38825) @[nolouch](https://github.com/nolouch) @[BornChanger](https://github.com/BornChanger) @[glorv](https://github.com/glorv) @[tiancaiamao](https://github.com/tiancaiamao) @[Connor1996](https://github.com/Connor1996) @[JmPotato](https://github.com/JmPotato) @[hnes](https://github.com/hnes) @[CabinfeverB](https://github.com/CabinfeverB) @[HuSharp](https://github.com/HuSharp)

    TiDB enhances the resource control feature based on resource groups, which becomes GA in v7.1.0. This feature significantly improves the resource utilization efficiency and performance of TiDB clusters. The introduction of the resource control feature is a milestone for TiDB. You can divide a distributed database cluster into multiple logical units, map different database users to corresponding resource groups, and set the quota for each resource group as needed. When the cluster resources are limited, all resources used by sessions in the same resource group are limited to the quota. In this way, even if a resource group is over-consumed, the sessions in other resource groups are not affected.

    With this feature, you can combine multiple small and medium-sized applications from different systems into a single TiDB cluster. When the workload of an application grows larger, it does not affect the normal operation of other applications. When the system workload is low, busy applications can still be allocated the required system resources even if they exceed the set quotas, which can achieve the maximum utilization of resources. In addition, the rational use of the resource control feature can reduce the number of clusters, ease the difficulty of operation and maintenance, and save management costs.

    In TiDB v7.1.0, this feature introduces the ability to estimate system capacity based on actual workload or hardware deployment. The estimation ability provides you with a more accurate reference for capacity planning and assists you in better managing TiDB resource allocation to meet the stability needs of enterprise-level scenarios.

    To improve user experience, TiDB Dashboard provides the [Resource Manager page](/dashboard/dashboard-resource-manager.md). You can view the resource group configuration on this page and estimate cluster capacity in a visual way to facilitate reasonable resource allocation.

    For more information, see [documentation](/tidb-resource-control.md).

* Support the checkpoint mechanism for Fast Online DDL to improve fault tolerance and automatic recovery capability [#42164](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/42164) @[tangenta](https://github.com/tangenta)

    TiDB v7.1.0 introduces a checkpoint mechanism for [Fast Online DDL](/ddl-introduction.md), which significantly improves the fault tolerance and automatic recovery capability of Fast Online DDL. Even if the TiDB owner node is restarted or changed due to failures, TiDB can still recover progress from checkpoints that are automatically updated on a regular basis, making the DDL execution more stable and efficient.

    For more information, see [documentation](/system-variables.md#tidb_ddl_enable_fast_reorg-new-in-v630).

* Backup & Restore supports checkpoint restore [#42339](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/42339) @[Leavrth](https://github.com/Leavrth)

    Snapshot restore or log restore might be interrupted due to recoverable errors, such as disk exhaustion and node crash. Before TiDB v7.1.0, the recovery progress before the interruption would be invalidated even after the error is addressed, and you need to start the restore from scratch. For large clusters, this incurs considerable extra cost.

    Starting from TiDB v7.1.0, Backup & Restore (BR) introduces the checkpoint restore feature, which enables you to continue an interrupted restore. This feature can retain most recovery progress of the interrupted restore.

    For more information, see [documentation](/br/br-checkpoint-restore.md).

* Optimize the strategy of loading statistics [#42160](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/42160) @[xuyifangreeneyes](https://github.com/xuyifangreeneyes)

   TiDB v7.1.0 introduces lightweight statistics initialization as an experimental feature. Lightweight statistics initialization can significantly reduce the number of statistics that must be loaded during startup, thus improving the speed of loading statistics. This feature increases the stability of TiDB in complex runtime environments and reduces the impact on the overall service when TiDB nodes restart. You can set the parameter [`lite-init-stats`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#lite-init-stats-new-in-v710) to `true` to enable this feature.

    During TiDB startup, SQL statements executed before the initial statistics are fully loaded might have suboptimal execution plans, thus causing performance issues. To avoid such issues, TiDB v7.1.0 introduces the configuration parameter [`force-init-stats`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#force-init-stats-new-in-v657-and-v710). With this option, you can control whether TiDB provides services only after statistics initialization has been finished during startup. This parameter is disabled by default.

    For more information, see [documentation](/statistics.md#load-statistics).

* TiCDC supports the data integrity validation feature for single-row data [#8718](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/8718) [#42747](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/42747) @[3AceShowHand](https://github.com/3AceShowHand) @[zyguan](https://github.com/zyguan)

    Starting from v7.1.0, TiCDC introduces the data integrity validation feature, which uses a checksum algorithm to validate the integrity of single-row data. This feature helps verify whether any error occurs in the process of writing data from TiDB, replicating it through TiCDC, and then writing it to a Kafka cluster. The data integrity validation feature only supports changefeeds that use Kafka as the downstream and currently supports the Avro protocol.

    For more information, see [documentation](/ticdc/ticdc-integrity-check.md).

* TiCDC optimizes DDL replication operations [#8686](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/8686) @[hi-rustin](https://github.com/Rustin170506)

    Before v7.1.0, when you perform a DDL operation that affects all rows on a large table (such as adding or deleting a column), the replication latency of TiCDC would significantly increase. Starting from v7.1.0, TiCDC optimizes this replication operation and mitigates the impact of DDL operations on downstream latency.

    For more information, see [documentation](/ticdc/ticdc-faq.md#does-ticdc-replicate-data-changes-caused-by-lossy-ddl-operations-to-the-downstream).

* Improve the stability of TiDB Lightning when importing TiB-level data [#43510](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/43510) [#43657](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/43657) @[D3Hunter](https://github.com/D3Hunter) @[lance6716](https://github.com/lance6716)

    Starting from v7.1.0, TiDB Lightning has added four configuration items to improve stability when importing TiB-level data.

    - `tikv-importer.region-split-batch-size` controls the number of Regions when splitting Regions in a batch. The default value is `4096`.
    - `tikv-importer.region-split-concurrency` controls the concurrency when splitting Regions. The default value is the number of CPU cores.
    - `tikv-importer.region-check-backoff-limit` controls the number of retries to wait for the Region to come online after the split and scatter operations. The default value is `1800` and the maximum retry interval is two seconds. The number of retries is not increased if any Region becomes online between retries.
    - `tikv-importer.pause-pd-scheduler-scope` controls the scope in which TiDB Lightning pauses PD scheduling. Value options are `"table"` and `"global"`. The default value is `"table"`. For TiDB versions earlier than v6.1.0, you can only configure the `"global"` option, which pauses global scheduling during data import. Starting from v6.1.0, the `"table"` option is supported, which means that scheduling is only paused for the Region that stores the target table data. It is recommended to set this configuration item to `"global"` in scenarios with large data volumes to improve stability.

  For more information, see [documentation](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md).

### SQL

* Support saving TiFlash query results using the `INSERT INTO SELECT` statement (GA) [#37515](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/37515) @[gengliqi](https://github.com/gengliqi)

    Starting from v6.5.0, TiDB supports pushing down the `SELECT` clause (analytical query) of the `INSERT INTO SELECT` statement to TiFlash. In this way, you can easily save the TiFlash query result to a TiDB table specified by `INSERT INTO` for further analysis, which takes effect as result caching (that is, result materialization).

    In v7.1.0, this feature is generally available. During the execution of the `SELECT` clause in the `INSERT INTO SELECT` statement, the optimizer can intelligently decide whether to push a query down to TiFlash based on the [SQL mode](/sql-mode.md) and the cost estimates of the TiFlash replica. Therefore, the `tidb_enable_tiflash_read_for_write_stmt` system variable introduced during the experimental phase is now deprecated. Note that the computation rules of `INSERT INTO SELECT` statements for TiFlash do not meet the `STRICT SQL Mode` requirement, so TiDB allows the `SELECT` clause in the `INSERT INTO SELECT` statement to be pushed down to TiFlash only when the [SQL mode](/sql-mode.md) of the current session is not strict, which means that the `sql_mode` value does not contain `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES` and `STRICT_ALL_TABLES`.

    For more information, see [documentation](/tiflash/tiflash-results-materialization.md).

* MySQL-compatible multi-valued indexes become generally available (GA) [#39592](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/39592) @[xiongjiwei](https://github.com/xiongjiwei) @[qw4990](https://github.com/qw4990) @[YangKeao](https://github.com/YangKeao)

    Filtering the values of an array in a JSON column is a common operation, but normal indexes cannot help speed up such an operation. Creating a multi-valued index on an array can greatly improve filtering performance. If an array in the JSON column has a multi-valued index, you can use the multi-valued index to filter retrieval conditions in `MEMBER OF()`, `JSON_CONTAINS()`, and `JSON_OVERLAPS()` functions, thereby reducing I/O consumption and improving operation speed.

    In v7.1.0, the multi-valued indexes feature becomes generally available (GA). It supports more complete data types and is compatible with TiDB tools. You can use multi-valued indexes to speed up the search operations on JSON arrays in production environments.

    For more information, see [documentation](/sql-statements/sql-statement-create-index.md#multi-valued-indexes).

* Improve the partition management for Hash and Key partitioned tables [#42728](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/42728) @[mjonss](https://github.com/mjonss)

    Before v7.1.0, Hash and Key partitioned tables in TiDB only support the `TRUNCATE PARTITION` partition management statement. Starting from v7.1.0, Hash and Key partitioned tables also support `ADD PARTITION` and `COALESCE PARTITION` partition management statements. Therefore, you can flexibly adjust the number of partitions in Hash and Key partitioned tables as needed. For example, you can increase the number of partitions with the `ADD PARTITION` statement, or decrease the number of partitions with the `COALESCE PARTITION` statement.

    For more information, see [documentation](/partitioned-table.md#manage-hash-and-key-partitions).

* The syntax of Range INTERVAL partitioning becomes generally available (GA) [#35683](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/35683) @[mjonss](https://github.com/mjonss)

    The syntax of Range INTERVAL partitioning (introduced in v6.3.0) becomes GA. With this syntax, you can define Range partitioning by a desired interval without enumerating all partitions, which drastically reduces the length of Range partitioning DDL statements. The syntax is equivalent to that of the original Range partitioning.

    For more information, see [documentation](/partitioned-table.md#range-interval-partitioning).

* Generated columns become generally available (GA) @[bb7133](https://github.com/bb7133)

    Generated columns are a valuable feature for a database. When creating a table, you can define that the value of a column is calculated based on the values of other columns in the table, rather than being explicitly inserted or updated by users. This generated column can be either a virtual column or a stored column. TiDB has supported MySQL-compatible generated columns since earlier versions, and this feature becomes GA in v7.1.0.

    Using generated columns can improve MySQL compatibility for TiDB, simplifying the process of migrating from MySQL. It also reduces data maintenance complexity and improves data consistency and query efficiency.

    For more information, see [documentation](/generated-columns.md).

### DB operations

* Support smooth cluster upgrade without manually canceling DDL operations (experimental) [#39751](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/39751) @[zimulala](https://github.com/zimulala)

    Before TiDB v7.1.0, to upgrade a cluster, you must manually cancel its running or queued DDL tasks before the upgrade and then add them back after the upgrade.

    To provide a smoother upgrade experience, TiDB v7.1.0 supports automatically pausing and resuming DDL tasks. Starting from v7.1.0, you can upgrade your clusters without manually canceling DDL tasks in advance. TiDB will automatically pause any running or queued user DDL tasks before the upgrade and resume these tasks after the rolling upgrade, making it easier for you to upgrade your TiDB clusters.

    For more information, see [documentation](/smooth-upgrade-tidb.md).

### Observability

* Enhance optimizer diagnostic information [#43122](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/43122) @[time-and-fate](https://github.com/time-and-fate)

    Obtaining sufficient information is the key to SQL performance diagnostics. In v7.1.0, TiDB continues to add optimizer runtime information to various diagnostic tools, providing better insights into how execution plans are selected and assisting in troubleshooting SQL performance issues. The new information includes:

### Security

* Replace the interface used for querying TiFlash system table information [#6941](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/6941) @[flowbehappy](https://github.com/flowbehappy)

    Starting from v7.1.0, when providing the query service of [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TIFLASH_TABLES`](/information-schema/information-schema-tiflash-tables.md) and [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TIFLASH_SEGMENTS`](/information-schema/information-schema-tiflash-segments.md) system tables for TiDB, TiFlash uses the gRPC port instead of the HTTP port, which avoids the security risks of the HTTP service.

* Support LDAP authentication [#43580](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/43580) @[YangKeao](https://github.com/YangKeao)

    Starting from v7.1.0, TiDB supports LDAP authentication and provides two authentication plugins: `authentication_ldap_sasl` and `authentication_ldap_simple`.

    For more information, see [documentation](/security-compatibility-with-mysql.md).

* Enhance the database auditing feature (Enterprise Edition)

    In v7.1.0, TiDB Enterprise Edition enhances the database auditing feature, which significantly expands its capacity and improves the user experience to meet the needs of enterprises for database security compliance:

    - Introduce the concepts of "Filter" and "Rule" for more granular audit event definitions and more fine-grained audit settings.
    - Support defining rules in JSON format, providing a more user-friendly configuration method.
    - Add automatic log rotation and space management functions, and support configuring log rotation in two dimensions: retention time and log size.
    - Support outputting audit logs in both TEXT and JSON formats, facilitating easier integration with third-party tools.
    - Support audit log redaction. You can replace all literals to enhance security.

  Database auditing is an important feature in TiDB Enterprise Edition. This feature provides a powerful monitoring and auditing tool for enterprises to ensure data security and compliance. It can help enterprise managers in tracking the source and impact of database operations to prevent illegal data theft or tampering. Furthermore, database auditing can also help enterprises meet various regulatory and compliance requirements, ensuring legal and ethical compliance. This feature has important application value for enterprise information security.

    For more information, see [user guide](https://static.pingcap.com/files/2023/09/18204824/TiDB-Database-Auditing-User-Guide1.pdf). This feature is included in TiDB Enterprise Edition. To use this feature, navigate to the [TiDB Enterprise](https://www.pingcap.com/tidb-enterprise) page to get TiDB Enterprise Edition.

## Compatibility changes

> **Note:**
>
> This section provides compatibility changes you need to know when you upgrade from v7.0.0 to the current version (v7.1.0). If you are upgrading from v6.6.0 or earlier versions to the current version, you might also need to check the compatibility changes introduced in intermediate versions.

### Behavior changes

* To improve security, TiFlash deprecates the HTTP service port (default `8123`) and uses the gRPC port as a replacement

    If you have upgraded TiFlash to v7.1.0, then during the TiDB upgrade to v7.1.0, TiDB cannot read the TiFlash system tables ([`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TIFLASH_TABLES`](/information-schema/information-schema-tiflash-tables.md) and [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TIFLASH_SEGMENTS`](/information-schema/information-schema-tiflash-segments.md)).

* TiDB Lightning in TiDB versions from v6.2.0 to v7.0.0 decides whether to pause global scheduling based on the TiDB cluster version. When TiDB cluster version >= v6.1.0, scheduling is only paused for the Region that stores the target table data and is resumed after the target table import is complete. While for other versions, TiDB Lightning pauses global scheduling. Starting from TiDB v7.1.0, you can control whether to pause global scheduling by configuring [`pause-pd-scheduler-scope`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md). By default, TiDB Lightning pauses scheduling for the Region that stores the target table data. If the target cluster version is earlier than v6.1.0, an error occurs. In this case, you can change the value of the parameter to `"global"` and try again.

* When you use [`FLASHBACK CLUSTER TO TIMESTAMP`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-flashback-cluster.md) in TiDB v7.1.0, some Regions might remain in the FLASHBACK process even after the completion of the FLASHBACK operation. It is recommended to avoid using this feature in v7.1.0. For more information, see issue [#44292](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/44292). If you have encountered this issue, you can use the [TiDB snapshot backup and restore](/br/br-snapshot-guide.md) feature to restore data.
