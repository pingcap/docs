# TiDB 7.1.1 Release Notes

Release date: July 24, 2023

TiDB version: 7.1.1

Quick access: [Quick start](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.1/quick-start-with-tidb) | [Production deployment](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.1/production-deployment-using-tiup)

## Compatibility changes

- TiDB introduces a new system variable `tidb_lock_unchanged_keys` to control whether to lock unchanged keys [#44714](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/44714) @[ekexium](https://github.com/ekexium)

### Behavior changes

- When processing update event, TiCDC splits an event into delete and insert events if the primary key or non-null unique index value is modified in the event. For more information, see [documentation](/ticdc/ticdc-split-update-behavior.md#transactions-containing-a-single-update-change).

## Improvements

+ TiDB

    - Plan Cache supports queries with more than 200 parameters [#44823](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/44823) @[qw4990](https://github.com/qw4990)
    - Optimize the performance of reading the dumped chunks from disk [#45125](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/45125) @[YangKeao](https://github.com/YangKeao)
