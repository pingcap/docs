# TiDB 6.5.8 Release Notes

Release date: February 2, 2024

TiDB version: 6.5.8

Quick access: [Quick start](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/quick-start-with-tidb) | [Production deployment](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/production-deployment-using-tiup) | [Installation packages](https://www.pingcap.com/download/?version=v6.5.8#version-list)

## Compatibility changes

- Introduce the TiKV configuration item [`gc.num-threads`](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/tikv-configuration-file#num-threads-new-in-v658) to set the number of GC threads when `enable-compaction-filter` is `false`  [#16101](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/16101) @[tonyxuqqi](https://github.com/tonyxuqqi)

## Improvements

+ TiFlash

+ Tools

        - Support [querying the downstream synchronization status of a changefeed](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/ticdc-open-api-v2#query-whether-a-specific-replication-task-is-completed), which helps you determine whether the upstream data changes received by TiCDC have been synchronized to the downstream system completely [#10289](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/10289) @[hongyunyan](https://github.com/hongyunyan)
