## Feature details

### Performance

* The optimizer allows pushing the `Projection` operator down to the storage engine by default [#51876](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/51876) @[yibin87](https://github.com/yibin87)

    Pushing the `Projection` operator down to the storage engine reduces data transfer between the compute engine and the storage engine, thereby improving SQL execution performance. This is particularly effective for queries containing [JSON query functions](/functions-and-operators/json-functions/json-functions-search.md) or [JSON value attribute functions](/functions-and-operators/json-functions/json-functions-return.md). Starting from v8.3.0, TiDB enables the `Projection` operator pushdown feature by default, by changing the default value of the system variable controlling this feature, [`tidb_opt_projection_push_down`](/system-variables.md#tidb_opt_projection_push_down-new-in-v610), from `OFF` to `ON`. When this feature is enabled, the optimizer automatically pushes eligible JSON query functions and JSON value attribute functions down to the storage engine.

    For more information, see [documentation](/system-variables.md#tidb_opt_projection_push_down-new-in-v610).

* Optimize batch processing strategy for KV (key-value) requests [#55206](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/55206) @[zyguan](https://github.com/zyguan)

    TiDB fetches data by sending KV requests to TiKV. Batching and processing KV requests in bulk can significantly improve execution performance. Before v8.3.0, the batching strategy in TiDB is less efficient. Starting from v8.3.0, TiDB introduces several more efficient batching strategies in addition to the existing one. You can configure different batching strategies using the [`tikv-client.batch-policy`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#batch-policy-new-in-v830) configuration item to accommodate various workloads.

    For more information, see [documentation](/tidb-configuration-file.md#batch-policy-new-in-v830).
    
* TiFlash introduces HashAgg aggregation calculation modes to improve the performance for high NDV data [#9196](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/9196) @[guo-shaoge](https://github.com/guo-shaoge)

    Before v8.3.0, TiFlash has low aggregation calculation efficiency during the first stage of HashAgg aggregation when handling data with high NDV (number of distinct values). Starting from v8.3.0, TiFlash introduces multiple HashAgg aggregation calculation modes to improve the aggregation performance for different data characteristics. To choose a desired HashAgg aggregation calculation mode, you can configure the [`tiflash_hashagg_preaggregation_mode`](/system-variables.md#tiflash_hashagg_preaggregation_mode-new-in-v830) system variable.

    For more information, see [documentation](/system-variables.md#tiflash_hashagg_preaggregation_mode-new-in-v830).

* Ignore unnecessary columns when collecting statistics [#53567](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/53567) @[hi-rustin](https://github.com/Rustin170506)

    When the optimizer generates an execution plan, it only needs statistics for some columns, such as columns in the filter conditions, columns in the join keys, and columns used for aggregation. Starting from v8.3.0, TiDB continuously observes the historical records of the columns used in SQL statements. By default, TiDB only collects statistics for columns with indexes and columns that are observed to require statistics collection. This speeds up the collection of statistics and avoids unnecessary resource consumption.

    When you upgrade your cluster from a version earlier than v8.3.0 to v8.3.0 or later, TiDB retains the original behavior by default, that is, collecting statistics for all columns. To enable this feature, you need to manually set the system variable [`tidb_analyze_column_options`](/system-variables.md#tidb_analyze_column_options-new-in-v830) to `PREDICATE`. For newly deployed clusters, this feature is enabled by default.

    For analytical systems with many random queries, you can set the system variable [`tidb_analyze_column_options`](/system-variables.md#tidb_analyze_column_options-new-in-v830) to `ALL` to collect statistics for all columns, to ensure the performance of random queries. For other types of systems, it is recommended to keep the default setting (`PREDICATE`) of [`tidb_analyze_column_options`](/system-variables.md#tidb_analyze_column_options-new-in-v830) to collect statistics for only necessary columns.

    For more information, see [documentation](/statistics.md#collect-statistics-on-some-columns).

* Improve the query performance of some system tables [#50305](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/50305) @[tangenta](https://github.com/tangenta)

    In previous versions, querying system tables has poor performance when the cluster size becomes large and there are a large number of tables.

    In v8.0.0, query performance is optimized for the following four system tables:

    - `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`
    - `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STATISTICS`
    - `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE`
    - `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS`

  In v8.3.0, the query performance is optimized for the following system tables, bringing a multi-fold performance improvement compared to v8.2.0.

    - `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CHECK_CONSTRAINTS`
    - `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
    - `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS`
    - `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA`
    - `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SEQUENCES`
    - `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS`
    - `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TIDB_CHECK_CONSTRAINTS`
    - `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TiDB_INDEXES`
    - `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TIDB_INDEX_USAGE`
    - `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS`

* Support partition pruning when partition expressions use the `EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH...)` function to improve query performance [#54209](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/54209) @[mjonss](https://github.com/mjonss)

    In previous versions, when partition expressions use the `EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH...)` function, partition pruning is not supported, resulting in poor query performance. Starting from v8.3.0, partition pruning is supported when partition expressions use the `EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH...)` function, which improves query performance.

    For more information, see [documentation](/partition-pruning.md#scenario-three).

* Improve the performance of `CREATE TABLE` by 1.4 times, `CREATE DATABASE` by 2.1 times, and `ADD COLUMN` by 2 times [#54436](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/54436) @[D3Hunter](https://github.com/D3Hunter)

    TiDB v8.0.0 introduces the system variable [`tidb_enable_fast_create_table`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_fast_create_table-new-in-v800) to improve table creation performance in batch table creation scenarios. In v8.3.0, when submitting the DDL statements for table creation concurrently through 10 sessions in a single database, the performance is improved by 1.4 times compared with v8.2.0.

    In v8.3.0, the performance of general DDLs in batch execution has improved compared to v8.2.0. The performance of `CREATE DATABASE` for 10 sessions concurrently improves by 19 times compared with v8.1.0 and 2.1 times compared with v8.2.0. The performance of using 10 sessions to add columns (`ADD COLUMN`) to multiple tables in the same database in batch has improved by 10 times compared with v8.1.0, and 2.1 times compared with v8.2.0. The performance of `ADD COLUMN` with 10 sessions on multiple tables in the same database has improved by 10 times compared with v8.1.0 and 2 times compared with v8.2.0.

    For more information, see [documentation](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_fast_create_table-new-in-v800).

* Partitioned tables support global indexes (experimental) [#45133](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/45133) @[mjonss](https://github.com/mjonss) @[Defined2014](https://github.com/Defined2014) @[jiyfhust](https://github.com/jiyfhust) @[L-maple](https://github.com/L-maple)

    In previous versions of partitioned tables, some limitations exist because global indexes are not supported. For example, the unique key must use every column in the table's partitioning expression. If the query condition does not use the partitioning key, the query will scan all partitions, resulting in poor performance. Starting from v7.6.0, the system variable [`tidb_enable_global_index`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_global_index-new-in-v760) is introduced to enable the global index feature. But this feature was under development at that time and it is not recommended to enable it.

    Starting with v8.3.0, the global index feature is released as an experimental feature. You can explicitly create a global index for a partitioned table with the keyword `Global` to remove the restriction that the unique key must use every column in the table's partitioning expression, to meet flexible business needs. Global indexes also enhance the performance of queries that do not include partition keys.

    For more information, see [documentation](/partitioned-table.md#global-indexes).

### Reliability

* Support streaming cursor result sets (experimental) [#54526](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/54526) @[YangKeao](https://github.com/YangKeao)

    When the application code retrieves the result set using [Cursor Fetch](/develop/dev-guide-connection-parameters.md#use-streamingresult-to-get-the-execution-result), TiDB usually first stores the complete result set in memory, and then returns the data to the client in batches. If the result set is too large, TiDB might temporarily write the result to the hard disk.

    Starting from v8.3.0, if you set the system variable [`tidb_enable_lazy_cursor_fetch`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_lazy_cursor_fetch-new-in-v830) to `ON`, TiDB no longer reads all data to the TiDB node, but gradually reads data to the TiDB node as the client reads. When TiDB processes large result sets, this feature reduces the memory usage of the TiDB node and improves the stability of the cluster.

    For more information, see [documentation](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_lazy_cursor_fetch-new-in-v830).

* Enhance SQL execution plan binding [#55280](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/55280) [#55343](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/55343) @[time-and-fate](https://github.com/time-and-fate)

    In OLTP scenarios, the optimal execution plan for most SQL statements is fixed. Implementing SQL execution plan binding for important SQL statements in the application can reduce the probability of the execution plan becoming worse and improve system stability. To meet the requirements of creating a large number of SQL execution plan bindings, TiDB enhances the capability and experience of SQL binding, including:

    - Use a single SQL statement to create SQL execution plan bindings from multiple historical execution plans to improve the efficiency of creating bindings.
    - The SQL execution plan binding supports more optimizer hints, and optimizes the conversion method for complex execution plans, making the binding more stable in restoring the execution plan.

  For more information, see [documentation](/sql-plan-management.md).

### Availability

* TiProxy supports built-in virtual IP management [#583](https://github.com/pingcap/tiproxy/issues/583) @[djshow832](https://github.com/djshow832)

    Before v8.3.0, when using primary-secondary mode for high availability, TiProxy requires an additional component to manage the virtual IP address. Starting from v8.3.0, TiProxy supports built-in virtual IP management. In primary-secondary mode, when a primary node fails over, the new primary node will automatically bind to the specified virtual IP, ensuring that clients can always connect to an available TiProxy through the virtual IP.

    To enable virtual IP management, specify the virtual IP address using the TiProxy configuration item [`ha.virtual-ip`](/tiproxy/tiproxy-configuration.md#virtual-ip) and specify the network interface to bind the virtual IP to using [`ha.interface`](/tiproxy/tiproxy-configuration.md#interface). The virtual IP will be bound to a TiProxy instance only when both of these configuration items are set.

    For more information, see [documentation](/tiproxy/tiproxy-overview.md).

### SQL

* Support upgrading `SELECT LOCK IN SHARE MODE` to exclusive locks [#54999](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/54999) @[cfzjywxk](https://github.com/cfzjywxk)

    TiDB does not support `SELECT LOCK IN SHARE MODE` yet. Starting from v8.3.0, TiDB supports upgrading `SELECT LOCK IN SHARE MODE` to exclusive locks to enable support for `SELECT LOCK IN SHARE MODE`. You can control whether to enable this feature by using the new system variable [`tidb_enable_shared_lock_promotion`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_shared_lock_promotion-new-in-v830).

    For more information, see [documentation](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_shared_lock_promotion-new-in-v830).

### Observability

* Show the progress of loading initial statistics [#53564](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/53564) @[hawkingrei](https://github.com/hawkingrei)

    TiDB loads basic statistics when it starts. In scenarios with many tables or partitions, this process can take a long time. When the configuration item [`force-init-stats`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#force-init-stats-new-in-v657-and-v710) is set to `ON`, TiDB does not provide services until the initial statistics are loaded. In this case, you need to observe the loading process to estimate the service start time.

    Starting from v8.3.0, TiDB prints the progress of loading initial statistics in stages in the log, so you can understand the running status. To provide formatted results to external tools, TiDB adds the additional [monitoring API](/tidb-monitoring-api.md) so you can obtain the progress of loading initial statistics at any time during the startup phase.

* Add metrics about Request Unit (RU) settings [#8444](https://github.com/tikv/pd/issues/8444) @[nolouch](https://github.com/nolouch)

### Security

* Enhance PD log redaction [#8305](https://github.com/tikv/pd/issues/8305) @[JmPotato](https://github.com/JmPotato)

    TiDB v8.0.0 enhances log redaction and supports marking user data in TiDB logs with `‹ ›`. Based on the marked logs, you can decide whether to redact the marked information when displaying the logs, thus increasing the flexibility of log redaction. In v8.2.0, TiFlash implements a similar log redaction enhancement.

    In v8.3.0, PD implements a similar log redaction enhancement. To use this feature, you can set the value of the PD configuration item `security.redact-info-log` to `"marker"`.

    For more information, see [documentation](/log-redaction.md#log-redaction-in-pd-side).

* Enhance TiKV log redaction [#17206](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/17206) @[lucasliang](https://github.com/LykxSassinator)

    TiDB v8.0.0 enhances log redaction and supports marking user data in TiDB logs with `‹ ›`. Based on the marked logs, you can decide whether to redact the marked information when displaying the logs, thus increasing the flexibility of log redaction. In v8.2.0, TiFlash implements a similar log redaction enhancement.

    In v8.3.0, TiKV implements a similar log redaction enhancement. To use this feature, you can set the value of the TiKV configuration item `security.redact-info-log` to `"marker"`.

    For more information, see [documentation](/log-redaction.md#log-redaction-in-tikv-side).

### Data migration

* TiCDC supports replicating DDL statements in bi-directional replication (BDR) mode (GA) [#10301](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/10301) [#48519](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/48519) @[okJiang](https://github.com/okJiang) @[asddongmen](https://github.com/asddongmen)

    TiCDC v7.6.0 introduced the replication of DDL statements with bi-directional replication configured. Previously, bi-directional replication of DDL statements was not supported by TiCDC, so users of TiCDC's bi-directional replication had to execute DDL statements on both TiDB clusters separately. With this feature, after assigning a `PRIMARY` BDR role to a cluster, TiCDC can replicate the DDL statements from that cluster to the `SECONDARY` cluster.

    In v8.3.0, this feature becomes generally available (GA).

    For more information, see [documentation](/ticdc/ticdc-bidirectional-replication.md).

## Compatibility changes

> **Note:**
>
> This section provides compatibility changes you need to know when you upgrade from v8.2.0 to the current version (v8.3.0). If you are upgrading from v8.1.0 or earlier versions to the current version, you might also need to check the compatibility changes introduced in intermediate versions.

### Behavior changes

* To avoid incorrect use of commands, `pd-ctl` cancels the prefix matching mechanism. For example, `store remove-tombstone` cannot be called via `store remove` [#8413](https://github.com/tikv/pd/issues/8413) @[lhy1024](https://github.com/lhy1024)

### System variables

| Variable name  | Change type   | Description |
|--------|------------------------------|------|
| [`tidb_ddl_reorg_batch_size`](/system-variables.md#tidb_ddl_reorg_batch_size)    | Modified   | Adds the SESSION scope.       |
| [`tidb_ddl_reorg_worker_cnt`](/system-variables.md#tidb_ddl_reorg_worker_cnt)  | Modified   | Adds the SESSION scope.    |
| [`tidb_gc_concurrency`](/system-variables.md#tidb_gc_concurrency-new-in-v50) | Modified | Starting from v8.3.0, this variable controls the number of concurrent threads during the [Resolve Locks](/garbage-collection-overview.md#resolve-locks) and [Delete Range](/garbage-collection-overview.md#delete-ranges) steps of the [Garbage Collection (GC)](/garbage-collection-overview.md) process. Before v8.3.0, this variable only controls the number of threads during the [Resolve Locks](/garbage-collection-overview.md#resolve-locks) step. |
| [`tidb_low_resolution_tso`](/system-variables.md#tidb_low_resolution_tso) | Modified | Adds the GLOBAL scope. |
| [`tidb_opt_projection_push_down`](/system-variables.md#tidb_opt_projection_push_down-new-in-v610) | Modified | Adds the GLOBAL scope and persists the variable value to the cluster. Changes the default value from `OFF` to `ON` after further tests, which means that the optimizer is allowed to push `Projection` down to the TiKV coprocessor. |
| [`tidb_schema_cache_size`](/system-variables.md#tidb_schema_cache_size-new-in-v800)    | Modified | The range of values has been modified to either `0` or `[536870912, 9223372036854775807]`. The minimum value is `536870912` bytes (that is, 512 MiB) to avoid setting a cache size that is too small and causing performance degradation. |
| [`tidb_analyze_column_options`](/system-variables.md#tidb_analyze_column_options-new-in-v830) | Newly added | Controls the behavior of the `ANALYZE TABLE` statement. Setting it to the default value `PREDICATE` means only collecting statistics for [predicate columns](/statistics.md#collect-statistics-on-some-columns); setting it to `ALL` means collecting statistics for all columns. |
| [`tidb_enable_lazy_cursor_fetch`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_lazy_cursor_fetch-new-in-v830) | Newly added | Controls the behavior of the [Cursor Fetch](/develop/dev-guide-connection-parameters.md#use-streamingresult-to-get-the-execution-result) feature. |
| [`tidb_enable_shared_lock_promotion`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_shared_lock_promotion-new-in-v830)       | Newly added  | Controls whether to enable the feature of upgrading shared locks to exclusive locks. The default value of this variable is `OFF`, which means that the function of upgrading shared locks to exclusive locks is disabled. |
| [`tiflash_hashagg_preaggregation_mode`](/system-variables.md#tiflash_hashagg_preaggregation_mode-new-in-v830) | Newly added | Controls the pre-aggregation strategy used during the first stage of two-stage or three-stage HashAgg operations pushed down to TiFlash. |

### Configuration file parameters

| Configuration file | Configuration parameter | Change type | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| TiDB | [`tikv-client.batch-policy`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#batch-policy-new-in-v830) | Newly added | Controls the batching strategy for requests from TiDB to TiKV. |
| PD   |  [`security.redact-info-log`](/pd-configuration-file.md#redact-info-log-new-in-v50) |  Modified | Support setting the value of the PD configuration item `security.redact-info-log` to `"marker"` to mark sensitive information in the log with `‹ ›` instead of shielding it directly. With the `"marker"` option, you can customize the redaction rules.  |
| TiKV  | [`security.redact-info-log`](/tikv-configuration-file.md#redact-info-log-new-in-v408)  | Modified | Support setting the value of the TiKV configuration item `security.redact-info-log` to `"marker"` to mark sensitive information in the log with `‹ ›` instead of shielding it directly. With the `"marker"` option, you can customize the redaction rules.  |
| TiFlash   | [`security.redact-info-log`](/tiflash/tiflash-configuration.md#configure-the-tiflash-learnertoml-file) | Modified |  Support setting the value of the TiFlash Learner configuration item `security.redact-info-log` to `"marker"` to mark sensitive information in the log with `‹ ›` instead of shielding it directly. With the `"marker"` option, you can customize the redaction rules.  |
| BR  | [`--allow-pitr-from-incremental`](/br/br-incremental-guide.md#limitations) | Newly added  | Controls whether incremental backups are compatible with subsequent log backups. The default value is `true`, which means that incremental backups are compatible with subsequent log backups. When you keep the default value `true`, the DDLs that need to be replayed are strictly checked before the incremental restore begins. |

### System tables

* The [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST`](/information-schema/information-schema-processlist.md) and [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CLUSTER_PROCESSLIST`](/information-schema/information-schema-processlist.md#cluster_processlist) system tables add the `SESSION_ALIAS` field to show the number of rows currently affected by the DML statement [#46889](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/46889) @[lcwangchao](https://github.com/lcwangchao)

## Deprecated features

* The following features are deprecated starting from v8.3.0:

    * Starting from v7.5.0, [TiDB Binlog](/tidb-binlog/tidb-binlog-overview.md) replication is deprecated. Starting from v8.3.0, TiDB Binlog is fully deprecated, with removal planned for a future release. For incremental data replication, use [TiCDC](/ticdc/ticdc-overview.md) instead. For point-in-time recovery (PITR), use [PITR](/br/br-pitr-guide.md).
    * Starting from v8.3.0, the [`tidb_enable_column_tracking`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_column_tracking-new-in-v540) system variable is deprecated. TiDB tracks predicate columns by default. For more information, see [`tidb_analyze_column_options`](/system-variables.md#tidb_analyze_column_options-new-in-v830).

* The following features are planned for deprecation in future versions:

    * TiDB introduces the system variable [`tidb_enable_auto_analyze_priority_queue`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_auto_analyze_priority_queue-new-in-v800), which controls whether priority queues are enabled to optimize the ordering of tasks that automatically collect statistics. In future releases, the priority queue will be the only way to order tasks for automatically collecting statistics, so this system variable will be deprecated.
    * TiDB introduces the system variable [`tidb_enable_async_merge_global_stats`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_async_merge_global_stats-new-in-v750) in v7.5.0. You can use it to set TiDB to use asynchronous merging of partition statistics to avoid OOM issues. In future releases, partition statistics will be merged asynchronously, so this system variable will be deprecated.
    * It is planned to redesign [the automatic evolution of execution plan bindings](/sql-plan-management.md#baseline-evolution) in subsequent releases, and the related variables and behavior will change.       
    * In v8.0.0, TiDB introduces the [`tidb_enable_parallel_hashagg_spill`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_parallel_hashagg_spill-new-in-v800) system variable to control whether TiDB supports disk spill for the concurrent HashAgg algorithm. In future versions, the [`tidb_enable_parallel_hashagg_spill`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_parallel_hashagg_spill-new-in-v800) system variable will be deprecated.
    * The TiDB Lightning parameter [`conflict.max-record-rows`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task) is planned for deprecation in a future release and will be subsequently removed. This parameter will be replaced by [`conflict.threshold`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task), which means that the maximum number of conflicting records is consistent with the maximum number of conflicting records that can be tolerated in a single import task.

* The following features are planned for removal in future versions:

    * Starting from v8.0.0, TiDB Lightning deprecates the [old version of conflict detection](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode-usage.md#the-old-version-of-conflict-detection-deprecated-in-v800) strategy for the physical import mode, and enables you to control the conflict detection strategy for both logical and physical import modes via the [`conflict.strategy`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task) parameter. The [`duplicate-resolution`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md) parameter for the old version of conflict detection will be removed in a future release.
