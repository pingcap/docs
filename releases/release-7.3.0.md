## Feature details

### Performance

* TiFlash supports the replica selection strategy [#44106](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/44106) @[XuHuaiyu](https://github.com/XuHuaiyu)

    Before v7.3.0, TiFlash uses replicas from all its nodes for data scanning and MPP calculations to maximize performance. Starting from v7.3.0, TiFlash introduces the replica selection strategy and lets you configure it using the [`tiflash_replica_read`](/system-variables.md#tiflash_replica_read-new-in-v730) system variable. This strategy supports selecting specific replicas based on the [zone attributes](/schedule-replicas-by-topology-labels.md#optional-configure-labels-for-tidb) of nodes and scheduling specific nodes for data scanning and MPP calculations.

    For a cluster that is deployed in multiple data centers and each data center has complete TiFlash data replicas, you can configure this strategy to only select TiFlash replicas from the current data center. This means data scanning and MPP calculations are performed only on TiFlash nodes in the current data center, which avoids excessive network data transmission across data centers.

    For more information, see [documentation](/system-variables.md#tiflash_replica_read-new-in-v730).

* TiFlash supports Runtime Filter within nodes [#40220](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/40220) @[elsa0520](https://github.com/elsa0520)

    Runtime Filter is a **dynamic predicate** generated during the query planning phase. In the process of table joining, these dynamic predicates can effectively filter out rows that do not meet the join conditions, reducing scan time and network overhead, and improving the efficiency of table joining. Starting from v7.3.0, TiFlash supports Runtime Filter within nodes, improving the overall performance of analytical queries. In some TPC-DS workloads, the performance can be improved by 10% to 50%.

    This feature is disabled by default in v7.3.0. To enable this feature, set the system variable [`tidb_runtime_filter_mode`](/system-variables.md#tidb_runtime_filter_mode-new-in-v720) to `LOCAL`.

    For more information, see [documentation](/runtime-filter.md).

* TiFlash supports executing common table expressions (CTEs) (experimental) [#43333](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/43333) @[winoros](https://github.com/winoros)

    Before v7.3.0, the MPP engine of TiFlash cannot execute queries that contain CTEs by default. To achieve the best execution performance within the MPP framework, you need to use the system variable [`tidb_opt_force_inline_cte`](/system-variables.md#tidb_opt_force_inline_cte-new-in-v630) to enforce inlining CTE.

    Starting from v7.3.0, TiFlash's MPP engine supports executing queries with CTEs without inlining them, allowing for optimal query execution within the MPP framework. In TPC-DS benchmark tests, compared with inlining CTEs, this feature has shown a 20% improvement in overall query execution speed for queries containing CTE.

    This feature is experimental and is disabled by default. It is controlled by the system variable [`tidb_opt_enable_mpp_shared_cte_execution`](/system-variables.md#tidb_opt_enable_mpp_shared_cte_execution-new-in-v720).

### Reliability

* Add new optimizer hints [#45520](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/45520) @[qw4990](https://github.com/qw4990)

    In v7.3.0, TiDB introduces several new optimizer hints to control the join methods between tables, including:

    - [`NO_MERGE_JOIN()`](/optimizer-hints.md#no_merge_joint1_name--tl_name-) selects join methods other than merge join.
    - [`NO_INDEX_JOIN()`](/optimizer-hints.md#no_index_joint1_name--tl_name-) selects join methods other than index nested loop join.
    - [`NO_INDEX_MERGE_JOIN()`](/optimizer-hints.md#no_index_merge_joint1_name--tl_name-) selects join methods other than index nested loop merge join.
    - [`NO_HASH_JOIN()`](/optimizer-hints.md#no_hash_joint1_name--tl_name-) selects join methods other than hash join.
    - [`NO_INDEX_HASH_JOIN()`](/optimizer-hints.md#no_index_hash_joint1_name--tl_name-) selects join methods other than [index nested loop hash join](/optimizer-hints.md#inl_hash_join).

  For more information, see [documentation](/optimizer-hints.md).

* Manually mark queries that use resources more than expected (experimental) [#43691](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/43691) @[Connor1996](https://github.com/Connor1996) @[CabinfeverB](https://github.com/CabinfeverB)

    In v7.2.0, TiDB automatically manages queries that use resources more than expected (Runaway Query) by automatically downgrading or canceling runaway queries. In actual practice, rules alone cannot cover all cases. Therefore, TiDB v7.3.0 introduces the ability to manually mark runaway queries. With the new command [`QUERY WATCH`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-query-watch.md), you can mark runaway queries based on SQL text, SQL Digest, or execution plan, and the marked runaway queries can be downgraded or cancelled.

    This feature provides an effective intervention method for sudden performance issues in the database. For performance issues caused by queries, before identifying the root cause, this feature can quickly alleviate its impact on overall performance, thereby improving system service quality.

    For more information, see [documentation](/tidb-resource-control.md#query-watch-parameters).

### SQL

* List and List COLUMNS partitioned tables support default partitions [#20679](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/20679) @[mjonss](https://github.com/mjonss) @[bb7133](https://github.com/bb7133)

    Before v7.3.0, when you use the `INSERT` statement to insert data into a List or List COLUMNS partitioned table, the data needs to meet the specified partitioning conditions of the table. If the data to be inserted does not meet any of these conditions, either the execution of the statement will fail or the non-compliant data will be ignored.

   Starting from v7.3.0, List and List COLUMNS partitioned tables support default partitions. After a default partition is created, if the data to be inserted does not meet any partitioning condition, it will be written to the default partition. This feature improves the usability of List and List COLUMNS partitioning, avoiding the execution failure of the `INSERT` statement or data being ignored due to data that does not meet partitioning conditions.

    Note that this feature is a TiDB extension to MySQL syntax. For a partitioned table with a default partition, the data in the table cannot be directly replicated to MySQL.

    For more information, see [documentation](/partitioned-table.md#list-partitioning).

### Observability

* Show the progress of collecting statistics [#44033](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/44033) @[hawkingrei](https://github.com/hawkingrei)

    Collecting statistics for large tables often takes a long time. In previous versions, you cannot see the progress of collecting statistics, and therefore cannot predict the completion time. TiDB v7.3.0 introduces a feature to show the progress of collecting statistics. You can view the overall workload, current progress, and estimated completion time for each subtask using the system table `mysql.analyze_jobs` or `SHOW ANALYZE STATUS`. In scenarios such as large-scale data import and SQL performance optimization, this feature helps you understand the overall task progress and improves the user experience.

    For more information, see [documentation](/sql-statements/sql-statement-show-analyze-status.md).

* Plan Replayer supports exporting historical statistics [#45038](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/45038) @[time-and-fate](https://github.com/time-and-fate)

    Starting from v7.3.0, with the newly added [`dump with stats as of timestamp`](/sql-plan-replayer.md) clause, you can use Plan Replayer to export the statistics of specified SQL-related objects at a specific point in time. During the diagnosis of execution plan issues, accurately capturing historical statistics can help analyze more precisely how the execution plan was generated at the time when the issue occurred. This helps identify the root cause of the issue and greatly improves efficiency in diagnosing execution plan issues.

    For more information, see [documentation](/sql-plan-replayer.md).

### Data migration

* TiDB Lightning introduces a new version of conflict data detection and handling strategy [#41629](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/41629) @[lance6716](https://github.com/lance6716)

    In previous versions, TiDB Lightning uses different conflict detection and handling methods for Logical Import Mode and Physical Import Mode, which are complex to configure and not easy for users to understand. In addition, Physical Import Mode cannot handle conflicts using the `replace` or `ignore` strategy. Starting from v7.3.0, TiDB Lightning introduces a unified conflict detection and handling strategy for both Logical Import Mode and Physical Import Mode. You can choose to report an error (`error`), replace (`replace`) or ignore (`ignore`) conflicting data when encountering conflicts. You can limit the number of conflict records, such as the task is interrupted and terminated after processing a specified number of conflict records. Furthermore, the system can record conflicting data for troubleshooting.

    For import data with many conflicts, it is recommended to use the new version of the conflict detection and handling strategy for better performance. In the lab environment, the new version strategy can improve the performance of conflict detection and handling up to three times faster than the old version. This performance value is for reference only. The actual performance might vary depending on your configuration, table structure, and the percentage of conflicting data. Note that the new version and the old version of the conflict strategy cannot be used at the same time. The old conflict detection and handling strategy will be deprecated in the future.

    For more information, see [documentation](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode-usage.md#conflict-detection).

* TiDB Lightning supports Partitioned Raft KV (experimental) [#14916](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/14916) @[GMHDBJD](https://github.com/GMHDBJD)

    TiDB Lightning now supports Partitioned Raft KV. This feature helps improve the data import performance of TiDB Lightning.

* TiDB Lightning introduces a new parameter `enable-diagnose-log` to enhance troubleshooting by printing more diagnostic logs [#45497](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/45497) @[D3Hunter](https://github.com/D3Hunter)

    By default, this feature is disabled and TiDB Lightning only prints logs containing `lightning/main`. When enabled, TiDB Lightning prints logs for all packages (including `client-go` and `tidb`) to help diagnose issues related to `client-go` and `tidb`.

    For more information, see [documentation](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-global).

## Compatibility changes

> **Note:**
>
> This section provides compatibility changes you need to know when you upgrade from v7.2.0 to the current version (v7.3.0). If you are upgrading from v7.1.0 or earlier versions to the current version, you might also need to check the compatibility changes introduced in intermediate versions.

### Behavior changes

* Backup & Restore (BR)

    - BR adds an empty cluster check before performing a full data restoration. By default, restoring data to a non-empty cluster is not allowed. If you want to force the restoration, you can use the `--filter` option to specify the corresponding table name to restore data to.

* TiDB Lightning

    - `tikv-importer.on-duplicate` is deprecated and replaced by [`conflict.strategy`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task).
    - The `max-error` parameter, which controls the maximum number of non-fatal errors that TiDB Lightning can tolerate before stopping the migration task, no longer limits import data conflicts. The [`conflict.threshold`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task) parameter now controls the maximum number of conflicting records that can be tolerated.

* TiCDC

    - When Kafka sink uses Avro protocol, if the `force-replicate` parameter is set to `true`, TiCDC reports an error when creating a changefeed.
    - Due to incompatibility between `delete-only-output-handle-key-columns` and `force-replicate` parameters, when both parameters are enabled, TiCDC reports an error when creating a changefeed.
    - When the output protocol is Open Protocol, the `UPDATE` events only output the changed columns.
