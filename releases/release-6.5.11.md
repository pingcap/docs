# TiDB 6.5.11 Release Notes

Release date: September 20, 2024

TiDB version: 6.5.11

Quick access: [Quick start](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/quick-start-with-tidb) | [Production deployment](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/production-deployment-using-tiup)

## Improvements

+ TiDB

    - By batch deleting TiFlash placement rules, improve the processing speed of data GC after performing the `TRUNCATE` or `DROP` operation on partitioned tables [#54068](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/54068) @[Lloyd-Pottiger](https://github.com/Lloyd-Pottiger)

+ TiKV

    - Optimize the compaction trigger mechanism of RocksDB to accelerate disk space reclamation when handling a large number of DELETE versions [#17269](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/17269) @[AndreMouche](https://github.com/AndreMouche)

+ TiFlash

    - Reduce lock conflicts under highly concurrent data read operations and optimize short query performance [#9125](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/9125) @[JinheLin](https://github.com/JinheLin)
    - Optimize the execution efficiency of `LENGTH()` and `ASCII()` functions [#9344](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/9344) @[xzhangxian1008](https://github.com/xzhangxian1008)

+ Tools

    + TiCDC

        - When the downstream is TiDB with the `SUPER` permission granted, TiCDC supports querying the execution status of `ADD INDEX DDL` from the downstream database to avoid data replication failure due to timeout in retrying executing the DDL statement in some cases [#10682](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/10682) @[CharlesCheung96](https://github.com/CharlesCheung96)
