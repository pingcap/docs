+ TiKV

    - Fix the issue of continuous SQL execution errors in the cluster after the PD leader is switched or PD is restarted [#12934](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/12934)
        - Cause: This issue is caused by a TiKV bug that TiKV does not retry sending heartbeat information to PD client after heartbeat requests fail, until TiKV reconnects to PD client. As a result, the Region information on the failed TiKV node becomes outdated, and TiDB cannot get the latest Region information, which causes SQL execution errors.
        - Affected versions: v5.3.2 and v5.4.2. This issue has been fixed in v5.3.3 and v5.4.3. If you are using v5.4.2, you can upgrade your cluster to v5.4.3.
        - Workaround: In addition to upgrade, you can also restart the TiKV nodes that cannot send Region heartbeat to PD, until there is no Region heartbeat to send.
    - Fix the issue that causes permission denied error when TiKV gets an error from the web identity provider and fails back to the default provider [#13122](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/13122)
    - Fix the issue that the PD client might cause deadlocks [#13191](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/13191)
    - Fix the issue that Regions might be overlapped if Raftstore is busy [#13160](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/13160)

+ PD

    - Fix the issue that PD cannot correctly handle dashboard proxy requests [#5321](https://github.com/tikv/pd/issues/5321)
    - Fix the issue that a removed tombstone store appears again after the PD leader transfer ​​[#4941](https://github.com/tikv/pd/issues/4941)
    - Fix the issue that the TiFlash learner replica might not be created [#5401](https://github.com/tikv/pd/issues/5401)

+ TiFlash

    - Fix the issue that the `format` function might return a `Data truncated` error [#4891](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/4891)
    - Fix the issue that TiFlash might crash due to an error in parallel aggregation [#5356](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/5356)
