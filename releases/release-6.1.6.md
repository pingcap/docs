# TiDB 6.1.6 Release Notes

Release date: April 12, 2023

TiDB version: 6.1.6

Quick access: [Quick start](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.1/quick-start-with-tidb) | [Production deployment](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.1/production-deployment-using-tiup)

## Compatibility changes

- TiCDC fixes the issue of incorrect encoding of FLOAT data in Avro [#8490](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/8490) @[3AceShowHand](https://github.com/3AceShowHand)

    When upgrading the TiCDC cluster to v6.1.6 or a later v6.1.x version, if a table replicated using Avro contains the `FLOAT` data type, you need to manually adjust the compatibility policy of Confluent Schema Registry to `None` before upgrading so that the changefeed can successfully update the schema. Otherwise, after upgrading, the changefeed will be unable to update the schema and enter an error state.
