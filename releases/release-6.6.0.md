## Feature details

### Scalability

* Support Partitioned Raft KV storage engine (experimental) [#11515](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/11515) [#12842](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/12842) @[busyjay](https://github.com/busyjay) @[tonyxuqqi](https://github.com/tonyxuqqi) @[tabokie](https://github.com/tabokie) @[bufferflies](https://github.com/bufferflies) @[5kbpers](https://github.com/5kbpers) @[SpadeA-Tang](https://github.com/SpadeA-Tang) @[nolouch](https://github.com/nolouch)

    Before TiDB v6.6.0, TiKV's Raft-based storage engine used a single RocksDB instance to store the data of all 'Regions' of the TiKV instance. To support larger clusters more stably, starting from TiDB v6.6.0, a new TiKV storage engine is introduced, which uses multiple RocksDB instances to store TiKV Region data, and the data of each Region is independently stored in a separate RocksDB instance. The new engine can better control the number and level of files in the RocksDB instance, achieve physical isolation of data operations between Regions, and support stably managing more data. You can see it as TiKV managing multiple RocksDB instances through partitioning, which is why the feature is named Partitioned-Raft-KV. The main advantage of this feature is better write performance, faster scaling, and larger volume of data supported with the same hardware. It can also support larger cluster scales.

    Currently, this feature is experimental and not recommended for use in production environments.

    For more information, see [documentation](/partitioned-raft-kv.md).

* Support the distributed parallel execution framework for DDL operations (experimental) [#37125](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/37125) @[zimulala](https://github.com/zimulala)

    In previous versions, only one TiDB instance in the entire TiDB cluster was allowed to handle schema change tasks as a DDL owner. To further improve DDL concurrency for large table's DDL operations, TiDB v6.6.0 introduces the distributed parallel execution framework for DDL, through which all TiDB instances in the cluster can concurrently execute the `StateWriteReorganization` phase of the same task to speed up DDL execution. This feature is controlled by the system variable [`tidb_ddl_distribute_reorg`](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.6/system-variables#tidb_ddl_distribute_reorg-new-in-v660) and is currently only supported for `Add Index` operations.

### Performance

* Support a stable wake-up model for pessimistic lock queues [#13298](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/13298) @[MyonKeminta](https://github.com/MyonKeminta)

    If an application encounters frequent single-point pessimistic lock conflicts, the existing wake-up mechanism cannot guarantee the time for transactions to acquire locks, which causes high long-tail latency and even lock acquisition timeout. Starting from v6.6.0, you can enable a stable wake-up model for pessimistic locks by setting the value of the system variable [`tidb_pessimistic_txn_aggressive_locking`](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.6/system-variables#tidb_pessimistic_txn_aggressive_locking-new-in-v660) to `ON`. In this wake-up model, the wake-up sequence of a queue can be strictly controlled to avoid the waste of resources caused by invalid wake-ups. In scenarios with serious lock conflicts, the stable wake-up model can reduce long-tail latency and the P99 response time.

    Tests indicate this reduces tail latency 40-60%.

    For more information, see [documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.6/system-variables#tidb_pessimistic_txn_aggressive_locking-new-in-v660).

* Batch aggregate data requests [#39361](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/39361) @[cfzjywxk](https://github.com/cfzjywxk) @[you06](https://github.com/you06)

    When TiDB sends a data request to TiKV, TiDB compiles the request into different sub-tasks according to the Region where the data is located, and each sub-task only processes the request of a single Region. When the data to be accessed is highly dispersed, even if the size of the data is not large, many sub-tasks will be generated, which in turn will generate many RPC requests and consume extra time. Starting from v6.6.0, TiDB supports partially merging data requests that are sent to the same TiKV instance, which reduces the number of sub-tasks and the overhead of RPC requests. In the case of high data dispersion and insufficient gRPC thread pool resources, batching requests can improve performance by more than 50%.

    This feature is enabled by default. You can set the batch size of requests using the system variable [`tidb_store_batch_size`](/system-variables.md#tidb_store_batch_size).

* Remove the limit on `LIMIT` clauses [#40219](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/40219) @[fzzf678](https://github.com/fzzf678)

    Starting from v6.6.0, TiDB plan cache supports caching execution plans with a variable as the `LIMIT` parameter, such as `LIMIT ?` or `LIMIT 10, ?`. This feature allows more SQL statements to benefit from plan cache, thus improving execution efficiency. Currently, for security considerations, TiDB can only cache execution plans with `?` not greater than 10000.

    For more information, see [documentation](/sql-prepared-plan-cache.md).

* TiFlash supports data exchange with compression [#6620](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/6620) @[solotzg](https://github.com/solotzg)

    To cooperate with multiple nodes for computing, the TiFlash engine needs to exchange data among different nodes. When the size of the data to be exchanged is very large, the performance of data exchange might affect the overall computing efficiency. In v6.6.0, the TiFlash engine introduces a compression mechanism to compress the data that needs to be exchanged when necessary, and then to perform the exchange, thereby improving the efficiency of data exchange.

    For more information, see [documentation](/explain-mpp.md#mpp-version-and-exchange-data-compression).

* TiFlash supports the Stale Read feature [#4483](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/4483) @[hehechen](https://github.com/hehechen)

   The Stale Read feature has been generally available (GA) since v5.1.1, which allows you to read historical data at a specific timestamp or within a specified time range. Stale read can reduce read latency and improve query performance by reading data from local TiKV replicas directly. Before v6.6.0, TiFlash does not support Stale Read. Even if a table has TiFlash replicas, Stale Read can only read its TiKV replicas.

   Starting from v6.6.0, TiFlash supports the Stale Read feature. When you query the historical data of a table using the [`AS OF TIMESTAMP`](/as-of-timestamp.md) syntax or the [`tidb_read_staleness`](/tidb-read-staleness.md) system variable, if the table has a TiFlash replica, the optimizer now can choose to read the corresponding data from the TiFlash replica, thus further improving query performance.

    For more information, see [documentation](/stale-read.md).

* Support pushing down the `regexp_replace` string function to TiFlash [#6115](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/6115) @[xzhangxian1008](https://github.com/xzhangxian1008)

### Reliability

* Support resource control based on resource groups (experimental) [#38825](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/38825) @[nolouch](https://github.com/nolouch) @[BornChanger](https://github.com/BornChanger) @[glorv](https://github.com/glorv) @[tiancaiamao](https://github.com/tiancaiamao) @[Connor1996](https://github.com/Connor1996) @[JmPotato](https://github.com/JmPotato) @[hnes](https://github.com/hnes) @[CabinfeverB](https://github.com/CabinfeverB) @[HuSharp](https://github.com/HuSharp)

    Now you can create resource groups for a TiDB cluster, bind different database users to corresponding resource groups, and set quotas for each resource group according to actual needs. When the cluster resources are limited, all resources used by sessions in the same resource group will be limited to the quota. In this way, even if a resource group is over-consumed, the sessions in other resource groups are not affected. TiDB provides a built-in view of the actual usage of resources on Grafana dashboards, assisting you to allocate resources more rationally.

    The introduction of the resource control feature is a milestone for TiDB. It can divide a distributed database cluster into multiple logical units. Even if an individual unit overuses resources, it does not crowd out the resources needed by other units.

    With this feature, you can:

    - Combine multiple small and medium-sized applications from different systems into a single TiDB cluster. When the workload of an application grows larger, it does not affect the normal operation of other applications. When the system workload is low, busy applications can still be allocated the required system resources even if they exceed the set read and write quotas, so as to achieve the maximum utilization of resources.
    - Choose to combine all test environments into a single TiDB cluster, or group the batch tasks that consume more resources into a single resource group. It can improve hardware utilization and reduce operating costs while ensuring that critical applications can always get the necessary resources.

  In addition, the rational use of the resource control feature can reduce the number of clusters, ease the difficulty of operation and maintenance, and save management costs.

  In v6.6, you need to enable both TiDB's global variable [`tidb_enable_resource_control`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_resource_control-new-in-v660) and the TiKV configuration item [`resource-control.enabled`](/tikv-configuration-file.md#resource-control) to enable resource control. Currently, the supported quota method is based on "[Request Unit (RU)](/tidb-resource-control.md#what-is-request-unit-ru)". RU is TiDB's unified abstraction unit for system resources such as CPU and IO.

  For more information, see [documentation](/tidb-resource-control.md).

* Binding historical execution plans is GA [#39199](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/39199) @[fzzf678](https://github.com/fzzf678)

    In v6.5.0, TiDB extends the binding targets in the [`CREATE [GLOBAL | SESSION] BINDING`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-create-binding.md) statements and supports creating bindings according to historical execution plans. In v6.6.0, this feature is GA. The selection of execution plans is not limited to the current TiDB node. Any historical execution plan generated by any TiDB node can be selected as the target of [SQL binding](/sql-statements/sql-statement-create-binding.md), which further improves the feature usability.

    For more information, see [documentation](/sql-plan-management.md#create-a-binding-according-to-a-historical-execution-plan).

* Add several optimizer hints [#39964](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/39964) @[Reminiscent](https://github.com/Reminiscent)

    TiDB adds several optimizer hints in v6.6.0 to control the execution plan selection of `LIMIT` operations.

    - [`ORDER_INDEX()`](/optimizer-hints.md#order_indext1_name-idx1_name--idx2_name-): tells the optimizer to use the specified index, to keep the order of the index when reading data, and generates plans similar to `Limit + IndexScan(keep order: true)`.
    - [`NO_ORDER_INDEX()`](/optimizer-hints.md#no_order_indext1_name-idx1_name--idx2_name-): tells the optimizer to use the specified index, not to keep the order of the index when reading data, and generates plans similar to `TopN + IndexScan(keep order: false)`.

  Continuously introducing optimizer hints provides users with more intervention methods, helps solve SQL performance issues, and improves the stability of overall performance.

* Support dynamically managing the resource usage of DDL operations (experimental) [#38025](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/38025) @[hawkingrei](https://github.com/hawkingrei)

    TiDB v6.6.0 introduces resource management for DDL operations to reduce the impact of DDL changes on online applications by automatically controlling the CPU usage of these operations. This feature is effective only after the [DDL distributed parallel execution framework](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.6/system-variables#tidb_ddl_distribute_reorg-new-in-v660) is enabled.

### Availability

* Support configuring `SURVIVAL_PREFERENCE` for [placement rules in SQL](/placement-rules-in-sql.md) [#38605](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/38605) @[nolouch](https://github.com/nolouch)

    `SURVIVAL_PREFERENCES` provides data survival preference settings to increase the disaster survivability of data. By specifying `SURVIVAL_PREFERENCE`, you can control the following:

    - For TiDB clusters deployed across cloud regions, when a cloud region fails, the specified databases or tables can survive in another cloud region.
    - For TiDB clusters deployed in a single cloud region, when an availability zone fails, the specified databases or tables can survive in another availability zone.

  For more information, see [documentation](/placement-rules-in-sql.md#specify-survival-preferences).

* Support rolling back DDL operations via the `FLASHBACK CLUSTER TO TIMESTAMP` statement [#14045](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/14045) @[Defined2014](https://github.com/Defined2014) @[JmPotato](https://github.com/JmPotato)

    The [`FLASHBACK CLUSTER TO TIMESTAMP`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-flashback-cluster.md) statement supports restoring the entire cluster to a specified point in time within the Garbage Collection (GC) lifetime. In TiDB v6.6.0, this feature adds support for rolling back DDL operations. This can be used to quickly undo a DML or DDL misoperation on a cluster, roll back a cluster within minutes, and roll back a cluster multiple times on the timeline to determine when specific data changes occurred.

    For more information, see [documentation](/sql-statements/sql-statement-flashback-cluster.md).

### SQL

* Support MySQL-compatible foreign key constraints (experimental) [#18209](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/18209) @[crazycs520](https://github.com/crazycs520)

    TiDB v6.6.0 introduces the foreign key constraints feature, which is compatible with MySQL. This feature supports referencing within a table or between tables, constraints validation, and cascade operations. This feature helps to migrate applications to TiDB, maintain data consistency, improve data quality, and facilitate data modeling.

    For more information, see [documentation](/foreign-key.md).

* Support MySQL-compatible multi-valued indexes (experimental) [#39592](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/39592) @[xiongjiwei](https://github.com/xiongjiwei) @[qw4990](https://github.com/qw4990)

    TiDB introduces MySQL-compatible multi-valued indexes in v6.6.0. Filtering the values of an array in a JSON column is a common operation, but normal indexes cannot help speed up such an operation. Creating a multi-valued index on an array can greatly improve filtering performance. If an array in the JSON column has a multi-valued index, you can use the multi-valued index to filter the retrieval conditions with `MEMBER OF()`, `JSON_CONTAINS()`, `JSON_OVERLAPS()` functions, thereby reducing much I/O consumption and improving operation speed.

    Introducing multi-valued indexes further enhances TiDB's support for the JSON data type and also improves TiDB's compatibility with MySQL 8.0.

    For more information, see [documentation](/sql-statements/sql-statement-create-index.md#multi-valued-indexes).

### DB operations

* Support configuring read-only storage nodes for resource-consuming tasks @[v01dstar](https://github.com/v01dstar)

    In production environments, some read-only operations might consume a large number of resources regularly and affect the performance of the entire cluster, such as backups and large-scale data reading and analysis. TiDB v6.6.0 supports configuring read-only storage nodes for resource-consuming read-only tasks to reduce the impact on the online application. Currently, TiDB, TiSpark, and BR support reading data from read-only storage nodes. You can configure read-only storage nodes according to [steps](/best-practices/readonly-nodes.md#procedures) and specify where data is read through the system variable `tidb_replica_read`, the TiSpark configuration item `spark.tispark.replica_read`, or the br command line argument `--replica-read-label`, to ensure the stability of cluster performance.

    For more information, see [documentation](/best-practices/readonly-nodes.md).

* Support dynamically modifying `store-io-pool-size` [#13964](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/13964) @[LykxSassinator](https://github.com/LykxSassinator)

    The TiKV configuration item [`raftstore.store-io-pool-size`](/tikv-configuration-file.md#store-io-pool-size-new-in-v530) specifies the allowable number of threads that process Raft I/O tasks, which can be adjusted when tuning TiKV performance. Before v6.6.0, this configuration item cannot be modified dynamically. Starting from v6.6.0, you can modify this configuration without restarting the server, which means more flexible performance tuning.

    For more information, see [documentation](/dynamic-config.md).

* Support specifying the SQL script executed upon TiDB cluster initialization [#35624](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/35624) @[morgo](https://github.com/morgo)

    When you start a TiDB cluster for the first time, you can specify the SQL script to be executed by configuring the command line parameter `--initialize-sql-file`. You can use this feature when you need to perform such operations as modifying the value of a system variable, creating a user, or granting privileges.

    For more information, see [documentation](/tidb-configuration-file.md#initialize-sql-file-new-in-v660).

* TiDB Data Migration (DM) integrates with TiDB Lightning's physical import mode for up to a 10x performance boost for full migration (experimental) @[lance6716](https://github.com/lance6716)

    In v6.6.0, DM full migration capability integrates with physical import mode of TiDB Lightning, which enables DM to improve the performance of full data migration by up to 10 times, greatly reducing the migration time in large data volume scenarios.

    Before v6.6.0, for large data volume scenarios, you were required to configure physical import tasks in TiDB Lightning separately for fast full data migration, and then use DM for incremental data migration, which was a complex configuration. Starting from v6.6.0, you can migrate large data volumes without the need to configure TiDB Lightning tasks; one DM task can accomplish the migration.

    For more information, see [documentation](/dm/dm-precheck.md#check-items-for-physical-import).

* TiDB Lightning adds a new configuration parameter `"header-schema-match"` to address the issue of mismatched column names between the source file and the target table @[dsdashun](https://github.com/dsdashun)

    In v6.6.0, TiDB Lightning adds a new profile parameter `"header-schema-match"`. The default value is `true`, which means the first row of the source CSV file is treated as the column name, and consistent with that in the target table. If the field name in the CSV table header does not match the column name of the target table, you can set this configuration to `false`. TiDB Lightning will ignore the error and continue to import the data in the order of the columns in the target table.

    For more information, see [documentation](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task).

* TiDB Lightning supports enabling compressed transfers when sending key-value pairs to TiKV [#41163](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/41163) @[sleepymole](https://github.com/sleepymole)

    Starting from v6.6.0, TiDB Lightning supports compressing locally encoded and sorted key-value pairs for network transfer when sending them to TiKV, thus reducing the amount of data transferred over the network and lowering the network bandwidth overhead. In the earlier TiDB versions before this feature is supported, TiDB Lightning requires relatively high network bandwidth and incurs high traffic charges in case of large data volumes.

    This feature is disabled by default. To enable it, you can set the `compress-kv-pairs` configuration item of TiDB Lightning to `"gzip"` or `"gz"`.

    For more information, see [documentation](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task).

* The TiKV-CDC tool is now GA and supports subscribing to data changes of RawKV [#48](https://github.com/tikv/migration/issues/48) @[zeminzhou](https://github.com/zeminzhou) @[haojinming](https://github.com/haojinming) @[pingyu](https://github.com/pingyu)

    TiKV-CDC is a CDC (Change Data Capture) tool for TiKV clusters. TiKV and PD can constitute a KV database when used without TiDB, which is called RawKV. TiKV-CDC supports subscribing to data changes of RawKV and replicating them to a downstream TiKV cluster in real time, thus enabling cross-cluster replication of RawKV.

    For more information, see [documentation](https://tikv.org/docs/latest/concepts/explore-tikv-features/cdc/cdc/).

* TiCDC supports scaling out a single table on Kafka changefeeds and distributing the changefeed to multiple TiCDC nodes (experimental) [#7720](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/7720) @[overvenus](https://github.com/overvenus)

    Before v6.6.0, when a table in the upstream accepts a large amount of writes, the replication capability of this table cannot be scaled out, resulting in an increase in the replication latency. Starting from TiCDC v6.6.0. the changefeed of an upstream table can be distributed to multiple TiCDC nodes in a Kafka sink, which means the replication capability of a single table is scaled out.

    For more information, see [documentation](/ticdc/ticdc-sink-to-kafka.md#scale-out-the-load-of-a-single-large-table-to-multiple-ticdc-nodes).

* [GORM](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm) adds TiDB integration tests. Now TiDB is the default database supported by GORM. [#6014](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm/pull/6014) @[Icemap](https://github.com/Icemap)

    - In v1.4.6, [GORM MySQL driver](https://github.com/go-gorm/mysql) adapts to the `AUTO_RANDOM` attribute of TiDB [#104](https://github.com/go-gorm/mysql/pull/104)
    - In v1.4.6, [GORM MySQL driver](https://github.com/go-gorm/mysql) fixes the issue that when connecting to TiDB, the `Unique` attribute of the `Unique` field cannot be modified during `AutoMigrate` [#105](https://github.com/go-gorm/mysql/pull/105)
    - [GORM documentation](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm.io) mentions TiDB as the default database [#638](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm.io/pull/638)

    For more information, see [GORM documentation](https://gorm.io/docs/index.html).

### Observability

* Support quickly creating SQL binding on TiDB Dashboard [#781](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-dashboard/issues/781) @[YiniXu9506](https://github.com/YiniXu9506)

    TiDB v6.6.0 supports creating SQL binding from statement history, which allows you to quickly bind a SQL statement to a specific plan on TiDB Dashboard.

    By providing a user-friendly interface, this feature simplifies the process of binding plans in TiDB, reduces the operation complexity, and improves the efficiency and user experience of the plan binding process.

    For more information, see [documentation](/dashboard/dashboard-statement-details.md#fast-plan-binding).

* Add warning for caching execution plans @[qw4990](https://github.com/qw4990)

    When an execution plan cannot be cached, TiDB indicates the reason in warning to make diagnostics easier. For example:

    ```sql
    mysql> PREPARE st FROM 'SELECT * FROM t WHERE a<?';
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql> SET @a='1';
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql> EXECUTE st USING @a;
    Empty set, 1 warning (0.01 sec)

    mysql> SHOW WARNINGS;
    +---------+------+----------------------------------------------+
    | Level   | Code | Message                                      |
    +---------+------+----------------------------------------------+
    | Warning | 1105 | skip plan-cache: '1' may be converted to INT |
    +---------+------+----------------------------------------------+
    ```

    In the preceding example, the optimizer converts a non-INT type to an INT type, and the execution plan might change with the change of the parameter, so TiDB does not cache the plan.

* Add a `Warnings` field to the slow query log [#39893](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/39893) @[time-and-fate](https://github.com/time-and-fate)

    TiDB v6.6.0 adds a `Warnings` field to the slow query log to help diagnose performance issues. This field records warnings generated during the execution of a slow query. You can also view the warnings on the slow query page of TiDB Dashboard.

    For more information, see [documentation](/identify-slow-queries.md).

* Automatically capture the generation of SQL execution plans [#38779](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/38779) @[Yisaer](https://github.com/Yisaer)

    In the process of troubleshooting execution plan issues, `PLAN REPLAYER` can help preserve the scene and improve the efficiency of diagnosis. However, in some scenarios, the generation of some execution plans cannot be reproduced freely, which makes the diagnosis work more difficult.

    To address such issues, in TiDB v6.6.0, `PLAN REPLAYER` extends the capability of automatic capture. With the `PLAN REPLAYER CAPTURE` command, you can register the target SQL statement in advance and also specify the target execution plan at the same time. When TiDB detects the SQL statement or the execution plan that matches the registered target, it automatically generates and packages the `PLAN REPLAYER` information. When the execution plan is unstable, this feature can improve diagnostic efficiency.

    To use this feature, set the value of [`tidb_enable_plan_replayer_capture`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_plan_replayer_capture) to `ON`.

    For more information, see [documentation](/sql-plan-replayer.md#use-plan-replayer-capture).

* Support persisting statements summary (experimental) [#40812](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/40812) @[mornyx](https://github.com/mornyx)

    Before v6.6.0, statements summary data is kept in memory and would be lost upon a TiDB server restart. Starting from v6.6.0, TiDB supports enabling statements summary persistence, which allows historical data to be written to disks on a regular basis. In the meantime, the result of queries on system tables will derive from disks, instead of memory. After TiDB restarts, all historical data remains available.

    For more information, see [documentation](/statement-summary-tables.md#persist-statements-summary).

### Security

* TiFlash supports automatic rotations of TLS certificates [#5503](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/5503) @[ywqzzy](https://github.com/ywqzzy)

    In v6.6.0, TiDB supports automatic rotations of TiFlash TLS certificates. For a TiDB cluster with encrypted data transmission between components enabled, when a TLS certificate of TiFlash expires and needs to be reissued with a new one, the new TiFlash TLS certificate can be automatically loaded without restarting the TiDB cluster. In addition, the rotation of a TLS certificate between components within a TiDB cluster does not affect the use of the TiDB cluster, which ensures high availability of the cluster.

    For more information, see [documentation](/enable-tls-between-components.md).

* TiDB Lightning supports accessing Amazon S3 data via AWS IAM role keys and session tokens [#40750](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/40750) @[okJiang](https://github.com/okJiang)

    Before v6.6.0, TiDB Lightning only supports accessing S3 data via AWS IAM **user's access keys** (each access key consists of an access key ID and a secret access key) so you cannot use a temporary session token to access S3 data. Starting from v6.6.0, TiDB Lightning supports accessing S3 data via AWS IAM **role's access keys + session tokens** as well to improve the data security.

    For more information, see [documentation](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-data-source.md#import-data-from-amazon-s3).

### Telemetry

- Starting from February 20, 2023, the [telemetry feature](/telemetry.md) is disabled by default in new versions of TiDB and TiDB Dashboard (including v6.6.0). If you upgrade from a previous version that uses the default telemetry configuration, the telemetry feature is disabled after the upgrade. For the specific versions, see [TiDB Release Timeline](/releases/release-timeline.md).
- Starting from v1.11.3, the telemetry feature is disabled by default in newly deployed TiUP. If you upgrade from a previous version of TiUP to v1.11.3 or a later version, the telemetry feature keeps the same status as before the upgrade.

## Compatibility changes

> **Note:**
>
> This section provides compatibility changes you need to know when you upgrade from v6.5.0 to the current version (v6.6.0). If you are upgrading from v6.4.0 or earlier versions to the current version, you might also need to check the compatibility changes introduced in intermediate versions.

### System variables

| Variable name  | Change type    | Description |
|--------|------------------------------|------|
| `tidb_enable_amend_pessimistic_txn` | Deleted | Starting from v6.5.0, this variable is deprecated. Starting from v6.6.0, this variable and the `AMEND TRANSACTION` feature are deleted. TiDB will use [meta lock](/metadata-lock.md) to avoid the `Information schema is changed` error. |
| `tidb_enable_concurrent_ddl` | Deleted | This variable controls whether to allow TiDB to use concurrent DDL statements. When this variable is disabled, TiDB uses the old DDL execution framework, which provides limited support for concurrent DDL execution. Starting from v6.6.0, this variable is deleted and TiDB no longer supports the old DDL execution framework. |
| `tidb_ttl_job_run_interval` | Deleted | This variable is used to control the scheduling interval of TTL jobs in the background. Starting from v6.6.0, this variable is deleted, because TiDB provides the `TTL_JOB_INTERVAL` attribute for every table to control the TTL runtime, which is more flexible than `tidb_ttl_job_run_interval`. |

        - Optimize DM alert rules and content [#7376](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/7376) @[D3Hunter](https://github.com/D3Hunter)

             Previously, alerts similar to "DM_XXX_process_exits_with_error" were raised whenever a related error occurred. But some alerts are caused by idle database connections, which can be recovered after reconnecting. To reduce these kinds of alerts, DM divides errors into two types: automatically recoverable errors and unrecoverable errors:

            - For an error that is automatically recoverable, DM reports the alert only if the error occurs more than 3 times within 2 minutes.
            - For an error that is not automatically recoverable, DM maintains the original behavior and reports the alert immediately.
