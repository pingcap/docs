# TiDB 3.0.5 Release Notes

Release date: October 25, 2019

TiDB version: 3.0.5

TiDB Ansible version: 3.0.5

## TiDB

+ SQL Optimizer
    - Support boundary checking on Window Functions [#12404](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12404)
    - Fix the issue that `IndexJoin` on the partition table returns incorrect results [#12712](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12712)
    - Fix the issue that the `ifnull` function on the top of the outer join `Apply` operator returns incorrect results [#12694](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12694)
    - Fix the issue of update failure when a subquery was included in the `where` condition of `UPDATE` [#12597](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12597)
    - Fix the issue that outer join was incorrectly converted to inner join when the `cast` function was included in the query conditions [#12790](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12790)
    - Fix incorrect expression passing in the join condition of `AntiSemiJoin` [#12799](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12799)
    - Fix the statistics error caused by shallow copy when initializing statistics [#12817](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12817)
    - Fix the issue that the `str_to_date` function in TiDB returns a different result from MySQL when the date string and the format string do not match [#12725](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12725)
+ SQL Execution Engine
    - Fix the panic issue when the `from_unixtime` function handles null [#12551](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12551)
    - Fix the `invalid list index` error reported when canceling DDL jobs [#12671](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12671)
    - Fix the issue that arrays were out of bounds when Window Functions are used [#12660](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12660)
    - Improve the behavior of the `AutoIncrement` column when it is implicitly allocated, to keep it consistent with the default mode of MySQL auto-increment locking (["consecutive" lock mode](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-auto-increment-handling.html)): for the implicit allocation of multiple `AutoIncrement` IDs in a single-line `Insert` statement, TiDB guarantees the continuity of the allocated values. This improvement ensures that the JDBC `getGeneratedKeys()` method will get the correct results in any scenario. [#12602](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12602)
    - Fix the issue that the query is hanged when `HashAgg` serves as a child node of `Apply` [#12766](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12766)
    - Fix the issue that the `AND` and `OR` logical expressions return incorrect results when it comes to type conversion [#12811](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12811)
+ Server
    - Implement the interface function that modifies transaction TTL to help support large transactions later [#12397](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12397)
    - Support extending the transaction TTL as needed (up to 10 minutes) to support pessimistic transactions [#12579](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12579)
    - Adjust the number of times that TiDB caches schema changes and corresponding changed table information from 100 to 1024, and support modification by using the `tidb_max_delta_schema_count` system variable [#12502](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12502)
    - Update the behavior of the `kvrpc.Cleanup` protocol to no longer clean locks of transactions that are not overtime [#12417](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12417)
    - Support logging Partition table information to the `information_schema.tables` table [#12631](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12631)
    - Support modifying the TTL of Region Cache by configuring `region-cache-ttl` [#12683](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12683)
    - Support printing the execution plan compression-encoded information in the slow log. This feature is enabled by default and can be controlled by using the `slow-log-plan` configuration or the `tidb_record_plan_in_slow_log` variable. In addition, the `tidb_decode_plan` function can decode the execution plan column encoded information in the slow log into execution plan information. [#12808](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12808)
    - Support displaying memory usage information in the `information_schema.processlist` table [#12801](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12801)
    - Fix the issue that an error and an unexpected alarm might occur when the TiKV Client judges an idle connection [#12846](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12846)
    - Fix the issue that the `INSERT IGNORE` statement performance is decreased because `tikvSnapshot` does not properly cache the KV results of `BatchGet()` [#12872](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12872)
    - Fix the issue that the TiDB response speed was relatively low because of slow connection to some KV services [#12814](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12814)
+ DDL
    - Fix the issue that the `Create Table` operation does not correctly set the Int type default value for the Set column [#12267](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12267)
    - Support multiple `unique`s when creating a unique index in the `Create Table` statement [#12463](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12463)
    - Fix the issue that populating the default value of this column for existing rows might cause an error when adding a Bit type column using `Alter Table` [#12489](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12489)
    - Fix the failure of adding a partition when the Range partitioned table uses a Date or Datetime type column as the partitioning key [#12815](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12815)
    - Support checking the consistency of the partition type and the partition key type when creating a table or adding a partition, for the Range partitioned table with the Date or Datetime type column as the partition key [#12792](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12792)
    - Add a check that the Unique Key column set needs to be greater than or equal to the partitioned column set when creating a Range partitioned table [#12718](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12718)

    - Fix the issue that Rollback of the transaction Primary key is collapsed [#5646](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/5646), [#5671](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/5671)
    - Fix the issue that under pessimistic locks, point queries might return the previous version data [#5634](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/5634)
