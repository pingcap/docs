# TiDB 7.1.2 Release Notes

Release date: October 25, 2023

TiDB version: 7.1.2

Quick access: [Quick start](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.1/quick-start-with-tidb) | [Production deployment](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.1/production-deployment-using-tiup) | [Installation packages](https://www.pingcap.com/download/?version=v7.1.2#version-list)

## Compatibility changes

- Prohibit setting [`require_secure_transport`](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.1/system-variables#require_secure_transport-new-in-v610) to `ON` in Security Enhanced Mode (SEM) to prevent potential connectivity issues for users [#47665](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/47665) @[tiancaiamao](https://github.com/tiancaiamao)
- Disable the [smooth upgrade](/smooth-upgrade-tidb.md) feature by default. You can enable it by sending the `/upgrade/start` and `upgrade/finish` HTTP requests [#47172](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/47172) @[zimulala](https://github.com/zimulala)
- Introduce the [`tidb_opt_enable_hash_join`](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.1/system-variables#tidb_opt_enable_hash_join-new-in-v712) system variable to control whether the optimizer selects hash joins for tables [#46695](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/46695) @[coderplay](https://github.com/coderplay)
- Disable periodic compaction of RocksDB by default, so that the default behavior of TiKV RocksDB is now consistent with that in versions before v6.5.0. This change prevents potential performance impact caused by a significant number of compactions after upgrading. In addition, TiKV introduces two new configuration items [`rocksdb.[defaultcf|writecf|lockcf].periodic-compaction-seconds`](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.1/tikv-configuration-file#periodic-compaction-seconds-new-in-v712) and [`rocksdb.[defaultcf|writecf|lockcf].ttl`](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.1/tikv-configuration-file#ttl-new-in-v712), enabling you to manually configure periodic compaction of RocksDB [#15355](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/15355) @[LykxSassinator](https://github.com/LykxSassinator)
- TiCDC introduces the [`sink.csv.binary-encoding-method`](/ticdc/ticdc-changefeed-config.md#changefeed-configuration-parameters) configuration item to control the encoding method of binary data in the CSV protocol. The default value is `'base64'` [#9373](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/9373) @[CharlesCheung96](https://github.com/CharlesCheung96)
- TiCDC introduces the [`large-message-handle-option`](/ticdc/ticdc-sink-to-kafka.md#handle-messages-that-exceed-the-kafka-topic-limit) configuration item. It is empty by default, which means that the changefeed fails when the message size exceeds the limit of the Kafka topic. When this configuration is set to `"handle-key-only"`, if the message exceeds the size limit, only the handle key will be sent to reduce the message size; if the reduced message still exceeds the limit, then the changefeed fails [#9680](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/9680) @[3AceShowHand](https://github.com/3AceShowHand)

## Improvements

+ TiDB

    - Add new optimizer hints, including [`NO_MERGE_JOIN()`](/optimizer-hints.md#no_merge_joint1_name--tl_name-), [`NO_INDEX_JOIN()`](/optimizer-hints.md#no_index_joint1_name--tl_name-), [`NO_INDEX_MERGE_JOIN()`](/optimizer-hints.md#no_index_merge_joint1_name--tl_name-), [`NO_HASH_JOIN()`](/optimizer-hints.md#no_hash_joint1_name--tl_name-), and [`NO_INDEX_HASH_JOIN()`](/optimizer-hints.md#no_index_hash_joint1_name--tl_name-) [#45520](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/45520) @[qw4990](https://github.com/qw4990)

    - Avoid holding mutex when writing Titan manifest files to prevent affecting other threads [#15351](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/15351) @[Connor1996](https://github.com/Connor1996)

        - Reduce the CPU overhead of log backup `resolve lock` [#40759](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/40759) @[3pointer](https://github.com/3pointer)
        - Add a new restore parameter `WaitTiflashReady`. When this parameter is enabled, the restore operation will be completed after TiFlash replicas are successfully replicated [#43828](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/43828) [#46302](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/46302) @[3pointer](https://github.com/3pointer)
