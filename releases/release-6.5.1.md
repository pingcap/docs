# TiDB 6.5.1 Release Notes

Release date: March 10, 2023

TiDB version: 6.5.1

Quick access: [Quick start](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/quick-start-with-tidb) | [Production deployment](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/production-deployment-using-tiup)

## Compatibility changes

- Starting from February 20, 2023, the [telemetry feature](/telemetry.md) is disabled by default in new versions of TiDB and TiDB Dashboard, including v6.5.1, and usage information is not collected and shared with PingCAP. Before upgrading to these versions, if the cluster uses the default telemetry configuration, the telemetry feature is disabled after the upgrade. See [TiDB Release Timeline](/releases/release-timeline.md) for specific versions.

    - The default value of the [`tidb_enable_telemetry`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_telemetry-new-in-v402) system variable is changed from `ON` to `OFF`.
    - The default value of the TiDB [`enable-telemetry`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#enable-telemetry-new-in-v402) configuration item is changed from `true` to `false`.
    - The default value of the PD [`enable-telemetry`](/pd-configuration-file.md#enable-telemetry) configuration item is changed from `true` to `false`.

- Starting from v1.11.3, the telemetry feature is disabled by default in newly deployed TiUP, and usage information is not collected. If you upgrade from a TiUP version earlier than v1.11.3 to v1.11.3 or a later version, the telemetry feature keeps the same status as before the upgrade.

- No longer support modifying column types on partitioned tables because of potential correctness issues. [#40620](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/40620) @[mjonss](https://github.com/mjonss)

- The default value of the TiKV [`advance-ts-interval`](/tikv-configuration-file.md#advance-ts-interval) configuration item is changed from `1s` to `20s`. You can modify this configuration item to reduce the latency and improve the timeliness of the Stale Read data. See [Reduce Stale Read latency](/stale-read.md#reduce-stale-read-latency) for details.

## Improvements

+ TiDB

    - Starting from v6.5.1, the TiDB cluster deployed by TiDB Operator v1.4.3 or higher supports IPv6 addresses. This means that TiDB can support a larger address space and bring you better security and network performance.

        - Full support for IPv6 addressing: TiDB supports using IPv6 addresses for all network connections, including client connections, internal communication between nodes, and communication with external systems.
        - Dual-stack support: If you are not ready to fully switch to IPv6 yet, TiDB also supports dual-stack networks. This means that you can use both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in the same TiDB cluster and choose a network deployment mode that prioritizes IPv6 by configuration.

      For more information on IPv6 deployment, see [TiDB on Kubernetes documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/configure-a-tidb-cluster#ipv6-support).

    - Support specifying the SQL script executed upon TiDB cluster initialization [#35624](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/35624) @[morgo](https://github.com/morgo)

        TiDB v6.5.1 adds a new configuration item [`initialize-sql-file`](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/tidb-configuration-file#initialize-sql-file-new-in-v651). When you start a TiDB cluster for the first time, you can specify the SQL script to be executed by configuring the command line parameter `--initialize-sql-file`. You can use this feature when you need to perform such operations as modifying the value of a system variable, creating a user, or granting privileges. For more information, see [documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/tidb-configuration-file#initialize-sql-file-new-in-v651).
