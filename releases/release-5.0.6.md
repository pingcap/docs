# TiDB 5.0.6 Release Notes

Release date: December 31, 2021

TiDB version: 5.0.6

## Compatibility changes

+ Tools

    + TiCDC

        - Change the output of the `cdc server` command error from stdout to stderr [#3133](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/3133)
        - Set the default value of Kafka sink `max-message-bytes` to `10M` [#3081](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/3081)
        - Change the default value of Kafka Sink `partition-num` to 3 so that TiCDC distributes messages across Kafka partitions more evenly [#3337](https://github.com/pingcap/ticdc/issues/3337)

## Improvements

+ TiDB

    - Show the affected SQL statements in the debug log when the coprocessor encounters a lock, which is helpful in diagnosing problems [#27718](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/27718)

+ TiKV

    - Increase the speed of inserting SST files by moving the verification process to the `Import` thread pool from the `Apply` thread pool [#11239](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/11239)

    - Collapse some uncommon storage-related metrics in Grafana dashboard [#11681](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/11681)

+ PD

    - Speed up the exit process of schedulers [#4146](https://github.com/tikv/pd/issues/4146)
