# TiDB 6.5.6 Release Notes

Release date: December 7, 2023

TiDB version: 6.5.6

Quick access: [Quick start](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/quick-start-with-tidb) | [Production deployment](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/production-deployment-using-tiup) | [Installation packages](https://www.pingcap.com/download/?version=v6.5.6#version-list)

## Compatibility changes

- Prohibit setting [`require_secure_transport`](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/system-variables#require_secure_transport-new-in-v610) to `ON` in Security Enhanced Mode (SEM) to prevent potential connectivity issues for users [#47665](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/47665) @[tiancaiamao](https://github.com/tiancaiamao)
- Introduce the [`tidb_opt_enable_hash_join`](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/system-variables#tidb_opt_enable_hash_join-new-in-v656) system variable to control whether the optimizer selects hash joins for tables [#46695](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/46695) @[coderplay](https://github.com/coderplay)
- After further testing, the default value of the TiCDC Changefeed configuration item [`case-sensitive`](/ticdc/ticdc-changefeed-config.md) is changed from `true` to `false`. This means that by default, table and database names in the TiCDC configuration file are case-insensitive [#10047](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/10047) @[sdojjy](https://github.com/sdojjy)
- TiCDC Changefeed introduces the following new configuration items:
    - [`sql-mode`](/ticdc/ticdc-changefeed-config.md): enables you to set the [SQL mode](/ticdc/ticdc-ddl.md#sql-mode) used by TiCDC to parse DDL statements when TiCDC replicates data [#9876](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/9876) @[asddongmen](https://github.com/asddongmen)
    - [`encoding-worker-num`](/ticdc/ticdc-changefeed-config.md) and [`flush-worker-num`](/ticdc/ticdc-changefeed-config.md): enables you to set different concurrency parameters for the redo module based on specifications of different machines [#10048](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/10048) @[CharlesCheung96](https://github.com/CharlesCheung96)
    - [`compression`](/ticdc/ticdc-changefeed-config.md): enables you to configure the compression behavior of redo log files [#10176](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/10176) @[sdojjy](https://github.com/sdojjy)
    - [`sink.cloud-storage-config`](/ticdc/ticdc-changefeed-config.md): enables you to set the automatic cleanup of historical data when replicating data to object storage [#10109](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/10109) @[CharlesCheung96](https://github.com/CharlesCheung96)
