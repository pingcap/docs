# TiDB 3.0.14 Release Notes

Release date: May 9, 2020

TiDB version: 3.0.14

## Compatibility Changes

+ TiDB

    - Adjust the user privilege in `performance_schema` and `metrics_schema` from read-write to read-only [#15417](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/15417)

## Important Bug Fixes

+ TiDB

    - Fix the issue that the query result of `index join` is incorrect when the `join` condition has multiple equivalent conditions on the column with the `handle` attribute [#15734](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/15734)
    - Fix the panic that occurs when performing the `fast analyze` operation on the column with the `handle` attribute [#16079](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/16079)
    - Fix the issue that the `query` field in the DDL job structure is incorrect when the DDL statement is executed in a way of `prepare`. This issue might cause data inconsistency between the upstream and the downstream when Binlog is used for data replication. [#15443](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/15443)

+ TiKV
