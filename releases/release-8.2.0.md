## Feature details

### Performance

* Support pushing down the following JSON functions to TiKV [#50601](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/50601) @[dbsid](https://github.com/dbsid)

    * `JSON_ARRAY_APPEND()`
    * `JSON_MERGE_PATCH()`
    * `JSON_REPLACE()`

  For more information, see [documentation](/functions-and-operators/expressions-pushed-down.md).

* TiDB supports parallel sorting [#49217](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/49217) [#50746](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/50746) @[xzhangxian1008](https://github.com/xzhangxian1008)

    Before v8.2.0, TiDB only executes Sort operators sequentially, affecting query performance when sorting large amounts of data.

    Starting from v8.2.0, TiDB supports parallel sorting, which significantly improves sorting performance. This feature does not need manual configuration. TiDB automatically determines whether to use parallel sorting based on the value of the [`tidb_executor_concurrency`](/system-variables.md#tidb_executor_concurrency-new-in-v50) system variable.

    For more information, see [documentation](/system-variables.md#tidb_executor_concurrency-new-in-v50).

* The parallel HashAgg algorithm of TiDB supports disk spill (GA) [#35637](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/35637) @[xzhangxian1008](https://github.com/xzhangxian1008)

    TiDB v8.0.0 introduces the parallel HashAgg algorithm with disk spill support as an experimental feature. In v8.2.0, this feature becomes generally available (GA). When using the parallel HashAgg algorithm, TiDB automatically triggers data spill based on memory usage, thus balancing query performance and data throughput. This feature is enabled by default. The system variable `tidb_enable_parallel_hashagg_spill`, which controls this feature, will be deprecated in a future release.

    For more information, see [documentation](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_parallel_hashagg_spill-new-in-v800).

### Reliability

* Improve statistics loading efficiency by up to 10 times [#52831](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/52831) @[hawkingrei](https://github.com/hawkingrei)

    SaaS or PaaS applications can have a large number of data tables, which not only slow down the loading speed of the initial statistics, but also increase the failure rate of load synchronization under high loads. The startup time of TiDB and the accuracy of the execution plan can be affected. In v8.2.0, TiDB optimizes the process of loading statistics from multiple perspectives, such as the concurrency model and memory allocation, to reduce latency, improve throughput, and avoid slow loading of statistics that affect business scaling.

    Adaptive concurrent loading is now supported. By default, the configuration item [`stats-load-concurrency`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#stats-load-concurrency-new-in-v540) is set to `0`, and the concurrency of statistics loading is automatically selected based on the hardware specification.

   For more information, see [documentation](/tidb-configuration-file.md#stats-load-concurrency-new-in-v540).

### Availability

* TiProxy supports multiple load balancing policies [#465](https://github.com/pingcap/tiproxy/issues/465) @[djshow832](https://github.com/djshow832) @[xhebox](https://github.com/xhebox)

    TiProxy is the official proxy component of TiDB, located between the client and TiDB server. It provides load balancing and connection persistence functions for TiDB. Before v8.2.0, TiProxy defaults to v1.0.0, which only supports status-based and connection count-based load balancing policies for TiDB servers.

    Starting from v8.2.0, TiProxy defaults to v1.1.0 and introduces multiple load balancing policies. In addition to status-based and connection count-based policies, TiProxy supports dynamic load balancing based on health, memory, CPU, and location, improving the stability of the TiDB cluster.

    You can configure the combination and priority of load balancing policies through the [`policy`](/tiproxy/tiproxy-configuration.md#policy) configuration item.

    * `resource`: the resource priority policy performs load balancing based on the following priority order: status, health, memory, CPU, location, and connection count.
    * `location`: the location priority policy performs load balancing based on the following priority order: status, location, health, memory, CPU, and connection count.
    * `connection`: the minimum connection count priority policy performs load balancing based on the following priority order: status and connection count.

  For more information, see [documentation](/tiproxy/tiproxy-load-balance.md).

### SQL

* TiDB supports the JSON schema validation function [#52779](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/52779) @[dveeden](https://github.com/dveeden)

    Before v8.2.0, you need to rely on external tools or customized validation logic for JSON data validation, which increases the complexity of development and maintenance, and reduces development efficiency. Starting from v8.2.0, the `JSON_SCHEMA_VALID()` function is introduced. Using `JSON_SCHEMA_VALID()` in the `CHECK` constraint can help prevent non-conforming data from being inserted, rather than checking the data after it has been added. This function lets you verify the validity of JSON data directly in TiDB, improving the integrity and consistency of the data, and increasing the development efficiency.

    For more information, see [documentation](/functions-and-operators/json-functions.md#validation-functions).

### DB operations

* TiUP supports deploying PD microservices [#5766](https://github.com/tikv/pd/issues/5766) @[rleungx](https://github.com/rleungx)

    Starting from v8.0.0, PD supports the microservice mode. This mode splits the timestamp allocation and cluster scheduling functions of PD into separate microservices that can be deployed independently, thereby improving resource control and isolation, and reducing the impact between different services. Before v8.2.0, PD microservices can only be deployed using TiDB Operator.

    Starting from v8.2.0, PD microservices can also be deployed using TiUP. You can deploy the `tso` microservice and the `scheduling` microservice separately in a cluster to enhance PD performance scalability and address PD performance bottlenecks in large-scale clusters. It is recommended to use this mode when PD becomes a significant performance bottleneck that cannot be resolved by scaling up.

    For more information, see [user documentation](/pd-microservices.md).

* Add privilege control of switching resource groups [#53440](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/53440) @[glorv](https://github.com/glorv)

    TiDB lets users switch to other resource groups using the [`SET RESOURCE GROUP`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-set-resource-group.md) command or the [`RESOURCE_GROUP()`](/optimizer-hints.md#resource_groupresource_group_name) hint, which might lead to resource group abuse by some database users. TiDB v8.2.0 introduces privilege control of switching resource groups. Only database users granted the `RESOURCE_GROUP_ADMIN` or `RESOURCE_GROUP_USER` dynamic privilege can switch to other resource groups, enhancing the protection of system resources.

    To maintain compatibility, the original behavior is retained when upgrading from earlier versions to v8.2.0 or later versions. To enable the enhanced privilege control, set the new variable [`tidb_resource_control_strict_mode`](/system-variables.md#tidb_resource_control_strict_mode-new-in-v820) to `ON`.

    For more information, see [user documentation](/tidb-resource-control.md#bind-resource-groups).

### Observability

* Record the reason why an execution plan is not cached [#50618](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/50618) @[qw4990](https://github.com/qw4990)

    In some scenarios, you might want to cache most execution plans to save execution overhead and reduce latency. Currently, execution plan caching has some limitations on SQL. Execution plans of some SQL statements cannot be cached. It is difficult to identify the SQL statements that cannot be cached and the corresponding reasons.

    Therefore, starting from v8.2.0, new columns `PLAN_CACHE_UNQUALIFIED` and `PLAN_CACHE_UNQUALIFIED_LAST_REASON` are added to the system table [`STATEMENTS_SUMMARY`](/statement-summary-tables.md) to explain the reason why an execution plan cannot be cached, which can help you tune performance.

    For more information, see [documentation](/statement-summary-tables.md#fields-description).

### Security

* Enhance TiFlash log desensitization [#8977](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/8977) @[JaySon-Huang](https://github.com/JaySon-Huang)

    TiDB v8.0.0 enhances the log desensitization feature, enabling you to control whether user data in TiDB logs is wrapped in markers `‹ ›`. Based on the marked logs, you can decide whether to redact the marked information when displaying logs, thereby increasing the flexibility of log desensitization. In v8.2.0, TiFlash introduces a similar enhancement for log desensitization. To use this feature, set the TiFlash configuration item `security.redact_info_log` to `marker`.

    For more information, see [documentation](/tiflash/tiflash-configuration.md#configure-the-tiflashtoml-file).

### Data migration

* Align TiCDC Syncpoints across multiple changefeeds [#11212](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/11212) @[hongyunyan](https://github.com/hongyunyan)

    Before v8.2.0, aligning TiCDC Syncpoints across multiple changefeeds was challenging. The `startTs` of the changefeed had to be carefully selected when the changefeed was created, so it would align with the Syncpoints of other changefeeds. Starting from v8.2.0, Syncpoints for a changefeed are created as a multiple of the changefeed's `sync-point-interval` configuration. This change lets you align Syncpoints across multiple changefeeds that have the same `sync-point-interval` configuration, simplifying and improving the ability to align multiple downstream clusters.

    For more information, see [documentation](/ticdc/ticdc-upstream-downstream-check.md#notes).

* TiCDC Pulsar Sink supports using the `pulsar+http` and `pulsar+https` connection protocols [#11336](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/11336) @[SandeepPadhi](https://github.com/SandeepPadhi)

    Before v8.2.0, TiCDC Pulsar Sink only supports `pulsar` and `pulsar+ssl` connection protocols. Starting from v8.2.0, TiCDC Pulsar Sink also supports `pulsar+http` and `pulsar+https` protocols for connections. This enhancement improves the flexibility of connecting to Pulsar.

    For more information, see [documentation](/ticdc/ticdc-sink-to-pulsar.md#sink-uri).

## Compatibility changes

> **Note:**
>
> This section provides compatibility changes you need to know when you upgrade from v8.1.0 to the current version (v8.2.0). If you are upgrading from v8.0.0 or earlier versions to the current version, you might also need to check the compatibility changes introduced in intermediate versions.

### Behavior changes

* When using TiDB Lightning to import a CSV file, if you set `strict-format = true` to split a large CSV file into multiple small CSV files to improve concurrency and import performance, you need to explicitly specify `terminator`. The values can be `\r`, `\n` or `\r\n`. Failure to specify a line terminator might result in an exception when parsing the CSV file data. [#37338](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/37338) @[lance6716](https://github.com/lance6716)

* When using [`IMPORT INTO`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-import-into.md) to import a CSV file, if you specify the `SPLIT_FILE` parameter to split a large CSV file into multiple small CSV files to improve concurrency and import performance, you need to explicitly specify the line terminator `LINES_TERMINATED_BY`. The values can be `\r`, `\n` or `\r\n`. Failure to specify a line terminator might result in an exception when parsing the CSV file data. [#37338](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/37338) @[lance6716](https://github.com/lance6716)

* Before BR v8.2.0, performing [BR data restore](/br/backup-and-restore-overview.md) on a cluster with TiCDC replication tasks is not supported. Starting from v8.2.0, BR relaxes the restrictions on data restoration for TiCDC: if the BackupTS (the backup time) of the data to be restored is earlier than the changefeed [`CheckpointTS`](/ticdc/ticdc-architecture.md#checkpointts) (the timestamp that indicates the current replication progress), BR can proceed with the data restore normally. Considering that `BackupTS` is usually much earlier, it can be assumed that in most scenarios, BR supports restoring data for a cluster with TiCDC replication tasks. [#53131](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/53131) @[YuJuncen](https://github.com/YuJuncen)

### MySQL compatibility

* Before v8.2.0, executing the [`CREATE USER`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-create-user.md) statement with the `PASSWORD REQUIRE CURRENT DEFAULT` option returns an error because this option is not supported and cannot be parsed. Starting from v8.2.0, TiDB supports parsing and ignoring this option for compatibility with MySQL. [#53305](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/53305) @[dveeden](https://github.com/dveeden)

### System variables

| Variable name  | Change type   | Description |
|--------|------------------------------|------|
| [`tidb_analyze_distsql_scan_concurrency`](/system-variables.md#tidb_analyze_distsql_scan_concurrency-new-in-v760) | Modified  |  Changes the minimum value from `1` to `0`. When you set it to `0`, TiDB adaptively adjusts the concurrency of the `scan` operation when executing the `ANALYZE` operation based on the cluster size.|
| [`tidb_analyze_skip_column_types`](/system-variables.md#tidb_analyze_skip_column_types-new-in-v720) | Modified  | Starting from v8.2.0, TiDB does not collect columns of `MEDIUMTEXT` and `LONGTEXT` types by default to avoid potential OOM risks.|
| [`tidb_enable_historical_stats`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_historical_stats) | Modified   |  Changes the default value from `ON` to `OFF`, which turns off historical statistics to avoid potential stability issues.|
| [`tidb_executor_concurrency`](/system-variables.md#tidb_executor_concurrency-new-in-v50) | Modified | Adds support for setting the concurrency of the `sort` operator. |
| [`tidb_sysproc_scan_concurrency`](/system-variables.md#tidb_sysproc_scan_concurrency-new-in-v650) | Modified    | Changes the minimum value from `1` to `0`. When you set it to `0`, TiDB adaptively adjusts the concurrency of `scan` operations performed when executing internal SQL statements based on the cluster size.|
| [`tidb_resource_control_strict_mode`](/system-variables.md#tidb_resource_control_strict_mode-new-in-v820) | Newly added | Controls whether privilege control is applied to the [`SET RESOURCE GROUP`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-set-resource-group.md) statement and the [`RESOURCE_GROUP()`](/optimizer-hints.md#resource_groupresource_group_name) optimizer hint.|

### Configuration file parameters

| Configuration file | Configuration parameter | Change type | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| TiDB | [`stats-load-concurrency`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#stats-load-concurrency-new-in-v540) | Modified | Changes the default value from `5` to `0`, and the minimum value from `1` to `0`. The value `0` means the automatic mode, which automatically adjusts concurrency based on the configuration of the server. |
| TiDB | [`token-limit`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#token-limit) | Modified | Changes the maximum value from `18446744073709551615` (64-bit platform) and `4294967295` (32-bit platform) to `1048576` to avoid causing TiDB Server OOM when setting it too large. It means that the number of sessions that can execute requests concurrently can be configured to a maximum of `1048576`. |
| TiKV | [`max-apply-unpersisted-log-limit`](/tikv-configuration-file.md#max-apply-unpersisted-log-limit-new-in-v810) | Modified | Changes the default value from `0` to `1024` to reduce long-tail latency caused by I/O jitter on the TiKV node. It means that the maximum number of committed but not persisted Raft logs that can be applied is `1024` by default. |
| TiKV | [`server.grpc-compression-type`](/tikv-configuration-file.md#grpc-compression-type) | Modified | This configuration item now also controls the compression algorithm of response messages sent from TiKV to TiDB. Enabling compression might consume more CPU resources. |
| TiFlash | [`security.redact_info_log`](/tiflash/tiflash-configuration.md#configure-the-tiflashtoml-file) | Modified | Introduces a new value option `marker`. When you set the value to `marker`, all user data in the log is wrapped in `‹ ›`. |

### System tables

* The [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST`](/information-schema/information-schema-processlist.md) and [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CLUSTER_PROCESSLIST`](/information-schema/information-schema-processlist.md#cluster_processlist) system tables add the `SESSION_ALIAS` field to show the alias of the current session. [#46889](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/46889) @[lcwangchao](https://github.com/lcwangchao)

### Compiler versions

* To improve the TiFlash development experience, the minimum version of LLVM required to compile and build TiDB has been upgraded from 13.0 to 17.0. If you are a TiDB developer, you need to upgrade the version of your LLVM compiler to ensure a smooth build. [#7193](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/7193) @[Lloyd-Pottiger](https://github.com/Lloyd-Pottiger)

## Deprecated features

* The following features are deprecated starting from v8.2.0:

    * Starting from v8.2.0, the [`enable-replica-selector-v2`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#enable-replica-selector-v2-new-in-v800) configuration item is deprecated. The new version of the Region replica selector is used by default when sending RPC requests to TiKV.
    * Starting from v8.2.0, the BR snapshot restore parameter `--concurrency` is deprecated. As an alternative, you can configure the maximum number of concurrent tasks per TiKV node during snapshot restore using [`--tikv-max-restore-concurrency`](/br/use-br-command-line-tool.md#common-options).
    * Starting from v8.2.0, the BR snapshot restore parameter `--granularity` is deprecated, and the [coarse-grained Region scattering algorithm](/br/br-snapshot-guide.md#restore-cluster-snapshots) is enabled by default.

* The following features are planned for deprecation in future versions:

    * In v8.0.0, TiDB introduces the [`tidb_enable_auto_analyze_priority_queue`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_auto_analyze_priority_queue-new-in-v800) system variable to control whether to enable the priority queue to optimize the ordering of automatic statistics collection tasks. In future versions, the priority queue will become the only way to order automatic statistics collection tasks, and the [`tidb_enable_auto_analyze_priority_queue`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_auto_analyze_priority_queue-new-in-v800) system variable will be deprecated.
    * In v8.0.0, TiDB introduces the [`tidb_enable_parallel_hashagg_spill`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_parallel_hashagg_spill-new-in-v800) system variable to control whether TiDB supports disk spill for the concurrent HashAgg algorithm. In future versions, the [`tidb_enable_parallel_hashagg_spill`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_parallel_hashagg_spill-new-in-v800) system variable will be deprecated.
    * In v7.5.0, TiDB introduces the [`tidb_enable_async_merge_global_stats`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_async_merge_global_stats-new-in-v750) system variable to enable TiDB to merge partition statistics asynchronously to avoid OOM issues. In future versions, partition statistics will be merged asynchronously by default, and the [`tidb_enable_async_merge_global_stats`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_async_merge_global_stats-new-in-v750) system variable will be deprecated.
    * It is planned to redesign [the auto-evolution of execution plan bindings](/sql-plan-management.md#baseline-evolution) in subsequent releases, and the related variables and behavior will change.
    * The TiDB Lightning parameter [`conflict.max-record-rows`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task) is planned for deprecation in a future release and will be subsequently removed. This parameter will be replaced by [`conflict.threshold`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task), which means that the maximum number of conflicting records is consistent with the maximum number of conflicting records that can be tolerated in a single import task.

* The following features are planned for removal in future versions:

    * Starting from v8.0.0, TiDB Lightning deprecates the [old version of conflict detection](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode-usage.md#the-old-version-of-conflict-detection-deprecated-in-v800) strategy for the physical import mode, and enables you to control the conflict detection strategy for both logical and physical import modes via the [`conflict.strategy`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task) parameter. The [`duplicate-resolution`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md) parameter for the old version of conflict detection will be removed in a future release.

## Improvements

+ TiDB

    - Support parallel execution of [logical DDL statements (General DDL)](/ddl-introduction.md#types-of-ddl-statements). Compared with v8.1.0, when you use 10 sessions to submit different DDL statements concurrently, the performance is improved by 3 to 6 times [#53246](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/53246) @[D3Hunter](https://github.com/D3Hunter)
    - Improve the logic of matching multi-column indexes using expressions like `((a = 1 and b = 2 and c > 3) or (a = 4 and b = 5 and c > 6)) and d > 3` to produce a more accurate `Range` [#41598](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/41598) @[ghazalfamilyusa](https://github.com/ghazalfamilyusa)
