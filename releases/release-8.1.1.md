# TiDB 8.1.1 Release Notes

Release date: August 27, 2024

TiDB version: 8.1.1

Quick access: [Quick start](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/quick-start-with-tidb) | [Production deployment](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/production-deployment-using-tiup)

## Compatibility changes

- When using TiDB Lightning to import a CSV file, if you set `strict-format = true` to split a large CSV file into multiple small CSV files to improve concurrency and import performance, you need to explicitly specify `terminator`. The values can be `\r`, `\n` or `\r\n`. Failure to specify a line terminator might result in an exception when parsing the CSV file data. [#37338](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/37338) @[lance6716](https://github.com/lance6716)
- When using [`IMPORT INTO`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-import-into.md) to import a CSV file, if you specify the `SPLIT_FILE` parameter to split a large CSV file into multiple small CSV files to improve concurrency and import performance, you need to explicitly specify the line terminator `LINES_TERMINATED_BY`. The values can be `\r`, `\n` or `\r\n`. Failure to specify a line terminator might result in an exception when parsing the CSV file data. [#37338](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/37338) @[lance6716](https://github.com/lance6716)
- Change the default value of the [`tidb_enable_parallel_hashagg_spill`](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/system-variables#tidb_enable_parallel_hashagg_spill-new-in-v800) variable from `ON` to `OFF` to avoid incorrect query results caused by disk spill during parallel calculation. For clusters upgraded to v8.1.1 from v8.0.0 or v8.1.0, this variable will remain at its previous default value of `ON` after the upgrade, and it is recommended to manually change it to `OFF`. [#55290](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/55290) @[xzhangxian1008](https://github.com/xzhangxian1008)

## Offline package changes

In v8.1.1, `arbiter` is removed from the `TiDB-community-toolkit` [binary package](/binary-package.md).

## Improvements

+ TiDB

    - By batch deleting TiFlash placement rules, improve the processing speed of data GC after performing the `TRUNCATE` or `DROP` operation on partitioned tables [#54068](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/54068) @[Lloyd-Pottiger](https://github.com/Lloyd-Pottiger)
