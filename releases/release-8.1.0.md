## Feature details

### Reliability

* Support managing queries that consume more resources than expected (GA) [#43691](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/43691) @[nolouch](https://github.com/nolouch)

    Sudden SQL query performance problems can cause a decline in overall database performance, which is the most common challenge to database stability. The reasons for these problems are diverse, such as untested new SQL statements, drastic changes in data volume, and sudden changes in execution plans. These problems are difficult to avoid completely at the source. TiDB v7.2.0 has introduced the capability to manage queries that consume more resources than expected to quickly reduce the impact of sudden query performance problems. This feature becomes generally available in v8.1.0.

    You can set the maximum execution time for a query in a resource group. When the execution time of a query exceeds the set value, the priority of the query is automatically reduced or the query is canceled. You can also set immediately matching identified queries through text or execution plans within a period of time, to avoid excessive resource consumption during the identification phase when the concurrency of problematic queries is too high.

    TiDB also supports the manual marking of queries. By using the [`QUERY WATCH`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-query-watch.md) command, you can mark queries based on the SQL text, SQL Digest, or execution plan. The queries that match the mark can be downgraded or canceled, achieving the purpose of adding a SQL blocklist.

    The automatic management capability of queries that consume more resources than expected provides users with an effective means to quickly mitigate the impact of query problems on overall performance before the root cause is identified, thereby improving the stability of the database.

    For more information, see [documentation](/tidb-resource-control.md#manage-queries-that-consume-more-resources-than-expected-runaway-queries).

### SQL

* Support using more expressions to set default column values when creating a table (GA) [#50936](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/50936) @[zimulala](https://github.com/zimulala)

    Before v8.0.0, when you create a table, the default value of a column is limited to strings, numbers, dates, and certain expressions. Starting from v8.0.0, you can use more expressions as the default column values. For example, you can set the default value of a column to `DATE_FORMAT`. This feature helps you meet more diverse requirements. In v8.1.0, this feature becomes GA.

    Starting from v8.1.0, you can use expressions as default values when adding columns by `ADD COLUMN`.

    For more information, see [documentation](/data-type-default-values.md#specify-expressions-as-default-values).

### DB operations

* Enable the TiDB Distributed eXecution Framework (DXF) by default to enhance the performance and stability of `ADD INDEX` or `IMPORT INTO` tasks in parallel execution [#52441](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/52441) @[D3Hunter](https://github.com/D3Hunter)

    The DXF becomes generally available (GA) in v7.5.0, but it is disabled by default. This means that an `ADD INDEX` or `IMPORT INTO` task is executed only by one TiDB node by default.

    Starting from v8.1.0, TiDB enables this feature by default ([`tidb_enable_dist_task`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_dist_task-new-in-v710) defaults to `ON`). When enabled, the DXF can schedule multiple TiDB nodes to execute the same `ADD INDEX` or `IMPORT INTO` task in parallel, fully utilizing the resources of the TiDB cluster and greatly improving the performance of these tasks. In addition, you can linearly improve the performance of `ADD INDEX` and `IMPORT INTO` tasks by adding TiDB nodes and configuring [`tidb_service_scope`](/system-variables.md#tidb_service_scope-new-in-v740) for the newly added nodes.

    For more information, see [documentation](/tidb-distributed-execution-framework.md).

### Security

* Enhance TiDB log desensitization (GA) [#52364](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/52364) @[xhebox](https://github.com/xhebox)

    The enhanced TiDB log desensitization supports removing sensitive data when users view logs, implemented by marking SQL text information in log files. You can control whether to mark log information to enable secure use of TiDB logs in different scenarios, enhancing the security and flexibility of using log desensitization. To use this feature, set the system variable `tidb_redact_log` to `MARKER`, and then the SQL text in TiDB's runtime logs is marked. In addition, you can use the `collect-log` subcommand on the TiDB server to remove marked sensitive data from the logs and display the logs in a secure manner. You can also remove all markers and get the normal logs. This feature became generally available in v8.1.0.

    For more information, see [documentation](/system-variables.md#tidb_redact_log).

### Data migration

* Support the `IMPORT INTO ... FROM SELECT` syntax (GA) [#49883](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/49883) @[D3Hunter](https://github.com/D3Hunter)

    Before v8.0.0, importing query results into a target table could only be done using the `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` statement, which is relatively inefficient in some large dataset scenarios. In v8.0.0, TiDB introduces `IMPORT INTO ... FROM SELECT` as an experimental feature, which enables you to import the results of a `SELECT` query into an empty TiDB target table. It achieves up to 8 times the performance of `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` and significantly reduces the import time. In addition, you can use `IMPORT INTO ... FROM SELECT` to import historical data queried with [`AS OF TIMESTAMP`](/as-of-timestamp.md).

    In v8.1.0, the `IMPORT INTO ... FROM SELECT` syntax becomes generally available (GA), enriching the functionality scenarios of the `IMPORT INTO` statement.

    For more information, see [documentation](/sql-statements/sql-statement-import-into.md).

* TiDB Lightning simplifies conflict resolution strategies and supports handling conflicting data using the `replace` strategy (GA) [#51036](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/51036) @[lyzx2001](https://github.com/lyzx2001)

    Before v8.0.0, TiDB Lightning has [one data conflict resolution strategy](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-logical-import-mode-usage.md#conflict-detection) for the logical import mode and [two data conflict resolution strategies](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode-usage.md#conflict-detection) for the physical import mode, which are not easy to understand and configure.

    In v8.0.0, TiDB Lightning deprecates the [old version of conflict detection](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode-usage.md#the-old-version-of-conflict-detection-deprecated-in-v800) strategy for the physical import mode, enables you to control the conflict detection strategy for both logical and physical import modes via the [`conflict.strategy`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md) parameter (experimental), and simplifies the configuration of this parameter. In addition, in the physical import mode, the `replace` strategy supports retaining the latest data and overwriting the old data when the import detects data with primary key or unique key conflicts. In v8.1.0, the capability to handle conflicting data with the `replace` strategy becomes generally available (GA).

    For more information, see [documentation](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md).

* TiCDC supports client authentication [#10636](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/10636) @[CharlesCheung96](https://github.com/CharlesCheung96)

    In v8.1.0, TiCDC supports client authentication when you are using the TiCDC CLI or OpenAPI. This feature enables you to configure TiCDC to require client authentication using client certificates, thereby establishing mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS). Additionally, you can configure authentication based on TiDB username and password.

    For more information, see [documentation](/ticdc/ticdc-client-authentication.md).

## Compatibility changes

> **Note:**
>
> This section provides compatibility changes you need to know when you upgrade from v8.0.0 to the current version (v8.1.0). If you are upgrading from v7.6.0 or earlier versions to the current version, you might also need to check the compatibility changes introduced in intermediate versions.

### Behavior changes

* In earlier versions, the `tidb.tls` configuration item in TiDB Lightning treats values `"false"` and `""` the same, as well as treating the values `"preferred"` and `"skip-verify"` the same. Starting from v8.1.0, TiDB Lightning distinguishes the behavior of `"false"`, `""`, `"skip-verify"`, and `"preferred"` for `tidb.tls`. For more information, see [TiDB Lightning configuration](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md).
* For tables with `AUTO_ID_CACHE=1`, TiDB supports a [centralized auto-increment ID allocating service](/auto-increment.md#mysql-compatibility-mode). In earlier versions, the primary TiDB node of this service automatically performs a `forceRebase` operation when the TiDB process exits (for example, during the TiDB node restart) to keep auto-assigned IDs as consecutive as possible. However, when there are too many tables with `AUTO_ID_CACHE=1`, executing `forceRebase` becomes very time-consuming, preventing TiDB from restarting promptly and even blocking data writes, thus affecting system availability. To resolve this issue, starting from v8.1.0, TiDB removes the `forceRebase` behavior, but this change will cause some auto-assigned IDs to be non-consecutive during the failover.
* In earlier versions, when processing a transaction containing `UPDATE` changes, if the primary key or non-null unique index value is modified in an `UPDATE` event, TiCDC splits this event into `DELETE` and `INSERT` events. In v8.1.0, when using the MySQL sink, TiCDC splits an `UPDATE` event into `DELETE` and `INSERT` events if the transaction `commitTS` for the `UPDATE` change is less than TiCDC `thresholdTS` (which is the current timestamp that TiCDC fetches from PD at TiCDC startup). This behavior change addresses the issue of downstream data inconsistencies caused by the potentially incorrect order of `UPDATE` events received by TiCDC, which can lead to an incorrect order of split `DELETE` and `INSERT` events. For more information, see [documentation](/ticdc/ticdc-behavior-change.md#mysql-sink).

### System variables

| Variable name | Change type | Description |
|--------|------------------------------|------|
| [`tidb_auto_analyze_ratio`](/system-variables.md#tidb_auto_analyze_ratio) | Modified | Changes the value range from `[0, 18446744073709551615]` to `(0, 1]`. |
| [`tidb_enable_dist_task`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_dist_task-new-in-v710) | Modified | Changes the default value from `OFF` to `ON`. This means that Distributed eXecution Framework (DXF) is enabled by default, which fully utilizes the resources of the TiDB cluster and greatly improves the performance of `ADD INDEX` and `IMPORT INTO` tasks. If you want to upgrade a cluster with the DXF enabled to v8.1.0 or later, disable the DXF (by setting `tidb_enable_dist_task` to `OFF`) before the upgrade, which avoids `ADD INDEX` operations during the upgrade causing data index inconsistency. After the upgrade, you can manually enable the DXF. |
| [`tidb_service_scope`](/system-variables.md#tidb_service_scope-new-in-v740) | Modified | Changes the optional value from `""` or `background` to a string with a length of up to 64 characters, which enables you to control the service scope of each TiDB node more flexibly. Valid characters include digits `0-9`, letters `a-zA-Z`, underscores `_`, and hyphens `-`. The Distributed eXecution Framework (DXF) determines which TiDB nodes can be scheduled to execute distributed tasks based on the value of this variable. For specific rules, see [Task scheduling](/tidb-distributed-execution-framework.md#task-scheduling). |

### Configuration file parameters

| Configuration file | Configuration parameter | Change type | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| TiDB| [`concurrently-init-stats`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#concurrently-init-stats-new-in-v810-and-v752) | Newly added | Controls whether to initialize statistics concurrently during TiDB startup. The default value is `false`. |
| TiDB Lightning | [`conflict.max-record-rows`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-configuration) | Modified | Starting from v8.1.0, there is no need to configure `conflict.max-record-rows` manually, because TiDB Lightning automatically assigns the value of `conflict.max-record-rows` with the value of `conflict.threshold`, regardless of the user input. `conflict.max-record-rows` will be deprecated in a future release. |
| TiDB Lightning | [`conflict.threshold`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task) | Modified | Changes the default value from `9223372036854775807` to `10000` to quickly interrupt abnormal tasks so that you can make corresponding adjustments as soon as possible. This saves time and computational resources by avoiding the scenario where a large amount of conflicting data is discovered after the import, caused by abnormal data sources or incorrect table schema definitions. |
| TiCDC | [`security.client-allowed-user`](/ticdc/ticdc-server-config.md#cdc-server-configuration-file-parameters) | Newly added | Lists the usernames that are allowed for client authentication. Authentication requests with usernames not in this list will be rejected. The default value is null. |
| TiCDC | [`security.client-user-required`](/ticdc/ticdc-server-config.md#cdc-server-configuration-file-parameters) | Newly added | Controls whether to use username and password for client authentication. The default value is `false`. |
| TiCDC | [`security.mtls`](/ticdc/ticdc-server-config.md#cdc-server-configuration-file-parameters) | Newly added | Controls whether to enable the TLS client authentication. The default value is `false`. |
| TiCDC | [`sink.debezium.output-old-value`](/ticdc/ticdc-changefeed-config.md#changefeed-configuration-parameters) | Newly added | Controls whether to output the value before the row data changes. The default value is `true`. When it is disabled, the `UPDATE` event does not output the "before" field. |
| TiCDC | [`sink.open.output-old-value`](/ticdc/ticdc-changefeed-config.md#changefeed-configuration-parameters) | Newly added | Controls whether to output the value before the row data changes. The default value is `true`. When it is disabled, the `UPDATE` event does not output the "p" field. |

## Deprecated features

* It is planned to redesign [the auto-evolution of execution plan bindings](/sql-plan-management.md#baseline-evolution) in subsequent releases, and the related variables and behavior will change.
* The TiDB Lightning parameter [`conflict.max-record-rows`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task) is scheduled for deprecation in a future release and will be subsequently removed. This parameter will be replaced by `conflict.threshold`, which means that the maximum number of conflicting records is consistent with the maximum number of conflicting records that can be tolerated in a single import task.
* Starting from v8.0.0, TiDB Lightning deprecates the [old version of conflict detection](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode-usage.md#the-old-version-of-conflict-detection-deprecated-in-v800) strategy for the physical import mode, and enables you to control the conflict detection strategy for both logical and physical import modes via the [`conflict.strategy`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md) parameter. The [`duplicate-resolution`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md) parameter for the old version of conflict detection will be removed in a future release.
