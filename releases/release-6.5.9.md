# TiDB 6.5.9 Release Notes

Release date: April 12, 2024

TiDB version: 6.5.9

Quick access: [Quick start](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/quick-start-with-tidb) | [Production deployment](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/production-deployment-using-tiup) | [Installation packages](https://www.pingcap.com/download/?version=v6.5.9#version-list)

## Compatibility changes

- Add a TiKV configuration item [`track-and-verify-wals-in-manifest`](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/tikv-configuration-file#track-and-verify-wals-in-manifest-new-in-v659) for RocksDB, which helps you investigate possible corruption of Write Ahead Log (WAL) [#16549](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/16549) @[v01dstar](https://github.com/v01dstar)
- DR Auto-Sync supports configuring [`wait-recover-timeout`](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/two-data-centers-in-one-city-deployment#enable-the-dr-auto-sync-mode), which enables you to control the waiting time for switching back to the `sync-recover` status after the network recovers [#6295](https://github.com/tikv/pd/issues/6295) @[disksing](https://github.com/disksing)

## Improvements

+ TiDB

    - When `force-init-stats` is set to `true`, TiDB waits for statistics initialization to finish before providing services during TiDB startup. This setting no longer blocks the startup of HTTP servers, which enables users to continue monitoring [#50854](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/50854) @[hawkingrei](https://github.com/hawkingrei)
    - Optimize the issue that the `ANALYZE` statement blocks the metadata lock [#47475](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/47475) @[wjhuang2016](https://github.com/wjhuang2016)

+ TiKV

    - Remove unnecessary async blocks to reduce memory usage [#16540](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/16540) @[overvenus](https://github.com/overvenus)
    - Avoid performing IO operations on snapshot files in raftstore threads to improve TiKV stability [#16564](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/16564) @[Connor1996](https://github.com/Connor1996)
    - Add slow logs for peer and store messages [#16600](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/16600) @[Connor1996](https://github.com/Connor1996)

+ Tools

    + Backup & Restore (BR)

        - Optimize the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for log backup during rolling restarts. Now, the checkpoint lag of log backup tasks will be smaller during rolling restarts [#15410](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/15410) @[YuJuncen](https://github.com/YuJuncen)
        - Enhance the tolerance of log backup to merge operations. When encountering a reasonably long merge operation, log backup tasks are less likely to enter the error state [#16554](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/16554) @[YuJuncen](https://github.com/YuJuncen)
        - Support automatically abandoning log backup tasks when encountering a large checkpoint lag, to avoid prolonged blocking GC and potential cluster issues [#50803](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/50803) @[RidRisR](https://github.com/RidRisR)
        - Alleviate the issue that the latency of the PITR log backup progress increases when Region leadership migration occurs [#13638](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/13638) @[YuJuncen](https://github.com/YuJuncen)
        - Improve the speed of merging SST files during data restore by using a more efficient algorithm [#50613](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/50613) @[Leavrth](https://github.com/Leavrth)

        - Remove an outdated compatibility check when using Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as the external storage [#50533](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/50533) @[lance6716](https://github.com/lance6716)
        - Print the information of the slowest Region that affects global checkpoint advancement in logs and metrics during log backups [#51046](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/51046) @[YuJuncen](https://github.com/YuJuncen)
        - Refactor the BR exception handling mechanism to increase tolerance for unknown errors [#47656](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/47656) @[3pointer](https://github.com/3pointer)
