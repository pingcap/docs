# TiDB 4.0.16 Release Notes

Release date: December 17, 2021

TiDB version: 4.0.16

## Compatibility changes

+ TiKV

    - Before v4.0.16, when TiDB converts an illegal UTF-8 string to a Real type, an error is reported directly. Starting from v4.0.16, TiDB processes the conversion according to the legal UTF-8 prefix in the string [#11466](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/11466)

+ Tools

    + TiCDC

        - Change the default value of Kafka Sink `max-message-bytes` to 1 MB to prevent TiCDC from sending too large messages to Kafka clusters [#2962](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/2962)
        - Change the default value of Kafka Sink `partition-num` to 3 so that TiCDC distributes messages across Kafka partitions more evenly [#3337](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/3337)

## Improvements

+ TiDB

    - Upgrade the Grafana version from 7.5.7 to 7.5.11

+ TiKV

    - Reduce disk space consumption by adopting the zstd algorithm to compress SST files when restoring data using Backup & Restore or importing data using Local-backend of TiDB Lightning [#11469](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/11469)

+ Tools

    + Backup & Restore (BR)

        - Improve the robustness of restoring [#27421](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/27421)

    + TiCDC

        - Add a tick frequency limit to EtcdWorker to prevent frequent etcd writes from affecting PD services [#3112](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/3112)
        - Optimize rate limiting control on TiKV reloads to reduce gPRC congestion during changefeed initialization [#3110](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/3110)
