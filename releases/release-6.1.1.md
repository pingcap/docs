# TiDB 6.1.1 Release Notes

Release date: September 1, 2022

TiDB version: 6.1.1

Quick access: [Quick start](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.1/quick-start-with-tidb) | [Production deployment](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.1/production-deployment-using-tiup) | [Installation packages](https://www.pingcap.com/download/?version=v6.1.1#version-list)

## Compatibility changes

+ TiDB

    - Make the `SHOW DATABASES LIKE â€¦` statement case-insensitive [#34766](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/34766) @[e1ijah1](https://github.com/e1ijah1)
    - Change the default value of [`tidb_enable_outer_join_reorder`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_outer_join_reorder-new-in-v610) from `1` to `0`, which disables Join Reorder's support for Outer Join by default.

+ Diagnosis

    - Disable the Continuous Profiling feature by default, which avoids the possible TiFlash crash issue that occurs when this feature is enabled. For details, see [#5687](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/5687) @[mornyx](https://github.com/mornyx)

## Other changes

- Add the following contents in the `TiDB-community-toolkit` binary package. For details, see [TiDB Installation Packages](/binary-package.md).

    - `server-{version}-linux-amd64.tar.gz`
    - `grafana-{version}-linux-amd64.tar.gz`
    - `alertmanager-{version}-linux-amd64.tar.gz`
    - `prometheus-{version}-linux-amd64.tar.gz`
    - `blackbox_exporter-{version}-linux-amd64.tar.gz`
    - `node_exporter-{version}-linux-amd64.tar.gz`

- Introduce multi-level support for different quality standards on the combination of operating systems and CPU architectures. See [OS and platform requirements](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.1/hardware-and-software-requirements#os-and-platform-requirements).
