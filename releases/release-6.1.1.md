# TiDB 6.1.1 Release Notes

Release date: 2022-xx-xx

TiDB version: 6.1.1

## Compatibility changes

+ TiDB

    (dup: release-6.2.0.md > Bug fixes> TiDB)- Make the `SHOW DATABASES LIKE â€¦` statement case-insensitive [#34766](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/34766)
    - Change the default value of [`tidb_enable_outer_join_reorder`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_outer_join_reorder-new-in-v610) from `1` to `0`, which disables Join Reorder's support for Outer Join is enabled by default.

+ Diagnosis

    - Disable the Continuous Profiling feature by default, which avoids the possible TiFlash OOM issue that occurs when this feature is enabled. For details, see [#5687](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/5687).

## Other changes
