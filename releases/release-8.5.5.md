### Performance

* Point-in-time recovery (PITR) supports recovery from compacted log backups for faster restores [#56522](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/56522) @[YuJuncen](https://github.com/YuJuncen)

    Starting from v9.0.0, the compact log backup feature provides offline compaction capabilities, converting unstructured log backup data into structured SST files. This results in the following improvements:

    - SST files can be quickly imported into the cluster, **improving recovery performance**.
    - Redundant data is removed during compaction, **reducing storage space consumption**.
    - You can set longer full backup intervals while ensuring the Recovery Time Objective (RTO), **reducing the impact on applications**.

  For more information, see [documentation](/br/br-compact-log-backup.md).

### DB operations

* Improve the compatibility between ongoing log backup and snapshot restore [#58685](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/58685) @[BornChanger](https://github.com/BornChanger)

    Starting from v9.0.0, when a log backup task is running, if the conditions are met, you can still perform snapshot restore and allow the restored data to be properly recorded by the ongoing log backup. This enables ongoing log backups to proceed without having to stop them during the restore procedure.

    For more information, see [documentation](/br/br-pitr-manual.md#compatibility-between-ongoing-log-backup-and-snapshot-restore).
