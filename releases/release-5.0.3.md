# TiDB 5.0.3 Release Notes

Release date: July 2, 2021

TiDB version: 5.0.3

## Compatibility Changes

+ TiDB

    - After a v4.0 cluster is upgraded to v5.0 or a later version (dev or v5.1), the default value of the `tidb_multi_statement_mode` variable changes from `WARN` to `OFF`
    - TiDB is now compatible with MySQL 5.7's noop variable `innodb_default_row_format`. Setting this variable will have no effect. [#23541](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/23541)
