# TiDB 5.3.1 Release Notes

Release Date: March 3, 2022

TiDB version: 5.3.1

## Compatibility changes

- Tools

    + TiDB Lightning

        - Change the default value of `regionMaxKeyCount` from 1_440_000 to 1_280_000, to avoid too many empty Regions after data import [#30018](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/30018)
