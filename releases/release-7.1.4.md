# TiDB 7.1.4 Release Notes

Release date: March 11, 2024

TiDB version: 7.1.4

Quick access: [Quick start](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.1/quick-start-with-tidb) | [Production deployment](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.1/production-deployment-using-tiup) | [Installation packages](https://www.pingcap.com/download/?version=v7.1.4#version-list)

## Compatibility changes

- To reduce the overhead of log printing, TiFlash changes the default value of `logger.level` from `"debug"` to `"info"` [#8641](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/8641) @[JaySon-Huang](https://github.com/JaySon-Huang)
- Introduce the TiKV configuration item [`gc.num-threads`](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/tikv-configuration-file#num-threads-new-in-v658) to set the number of GC threads when `enable-compaction-filter` is `false`  [#16101](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/16101) @[tonyxuqqi](https://github.com/tonyxuqqi)

## Improvements

+ TiDB

    - Enhance the ability to convert `OUTER JOIN` to `INNER JOIN` in specific scenarios [#49616](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/49616) @[qw4990](https://github.com/qw4990)
    - When `force-init-stats` is set to `true`, TiDB waits for statistics initialization to finish before providing services during TiDB startup. This setting no longer blocks the startup of HTTP servers, which enables users to continue monitoring [#50854](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/50854) @[hawkingrei](https://github.com/hawkingrei)

+ TiKV

    - When TiKV detects the existence of corrupted SST files, it logs the specific reasons for the corruption [#16308](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/16308) @[overvenus](https://github.com/overvenus)

+ PD

    - Improve the speed of PD automatically updating cluster status when the backup cluster is disconnected [#6883](https://github.com/tikv/pd/issues/6883) @[disksing](https://github.com/disksing)

+ TiFlash

    - Reduce the impact of background GC tasks on read and write task latency [#8650](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/8650) @[JaySon-Huang](https://github.com/JaySon-Huang)
    - Reduce the impact of disk performance jitter on read latency [#8583](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflash/issues/8583) @[JaySon-Huang](https://github.com/JaySon-Huang)
