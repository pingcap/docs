# TiDB RC3 Release Notes

On June 20, 2017, TiDB RC4 is released!This release is focused on MySQL compatibility, SQL optimization, stability, and performance.

## Highlight

- The privilege management is refined to enable users to manage the data access privileges using the same way as in MySQL.
- DDL is accelerated.
- The load balancing policy and process are optimized for performance.
- TiDB Ansible is open sourced. By using TiDB-Ansilbe, you can deploy, upgrade, start and shutdown a TiDB cluster with one click.

## Detailed updates

    - Optimize the Cost Based Optimizer (CBO) framework
    - Refactor `Expression`
+ Support more complete privilege management
+ DDL acceleration
+ Support using HTTP API to get the data distribution information of tables
+ Support using system variables to control the query concurrency
+ Add more MySQL built-in functions
+ Support using system variables to automatically split a big transaction into smaller ones to commit

## Placement Driver (PD)

+ Support gRPC
+ Provide the Disaster Recovery Toolkit
