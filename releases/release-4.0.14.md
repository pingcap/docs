# TiDB 4.0.14 Release Notes

Release date: July 27, 2021

TiDB version: 4.0.14

## Compatibility changes

+ TiDB

    - Change the default value of `tidb_multi_statement_mode` from `WARN` to `OFF` in v4.0. It is recommended to use the multi-statement feature of your client library instead. See [the documentation on `tidb_multi_statement_mode`](/system-variables.md#tidb_multi_statement_mode-new-in-v4011) for details. [#25749](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/25749)
    - Upgrade Grafana dashboard from v6.1.16 to v7.5.7 to solve two security vulnerabilities. See the [Grafana blog post](https://grafana.com/blog/2020/06/03/grafana-6.7.4-and-7.0.2-released-with-important-security-fix/) for details.
    - Change the default value of the `tidb_stmt_summary_max_stmt_count` variable from `200` to `3000` [#25872](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/25872)

+ TiKV

    - Change the default value of `merge-check-tick-interval` from `10` to `2` to speed up the Region merge process [#9676](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/9676)

## Feature enhancements

+ TiKV

    - Add a metric `pending` to monitor the number of pending PD heartbeats, which helps locate the issue of slow PD threads [#10008](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/10008)
    - Support using the virtual-host addressing mode to make BR support the S3-compatible storage [#10242](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/10242)

+ TiDB Dashboard

    - Support OIDC SSO. By setting the OIDC-compatible SSO services (such as Okta and Auth0), users can log into TiDB Dashboard without entering the SQL password. [#960](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-dashboard/pull/960)
    - Add the **Debug API** UI, which is an alternative method to the command line to call several common TiDB and PD internal APIs for advanced debugging [#927](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-dashboard/pull/927)

## Improvements

+ TiDB

    - Change the `LOCK` record into the `PUT` record for the index keys using `point get` or `batch point get` for `UPDATE` reads [#26223](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/26223)
