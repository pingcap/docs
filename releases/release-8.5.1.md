# TiDB 8.5.1 Release Notes

Release date: January 17, 2025

TiDB version: 8.5.1

Quick access: [Quick start](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/quick-start-with-tidb) | [Production deployment](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/production-deployment-using-tiup)

## Operating system and platform requirement changes

Starting from v8.5.1, TiDB resumes testing of CentOS Linux 7 and is compatible with it. If you plan to deploy TiDB v8.5 or upgrade your cluster to v8.5, ensure you use TiDB v8.5.1 or a later version.

- TiDB v8.4.0 DMR and v8.5.0 releases dropped support and testing with CentOS Linux 7 because it reached [EOL status on June 30, 2024](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/centos-linux-eol). Upgrading a TiDB cluster on CentOS 7 to v8.4.0 or v8.5.0 will cause the risk of cluster unavailability.

- To assist users still using CentOS Linux 7, TiDB resumes testing of CentOS Linux 7 starting from v8.5.1. However, due to the EOL status of CentOS Linux, it is strongly recommended that you review the [official announcements and security guidance](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/centos-linux-has-reached-its-end-life-eol) for CentOS Linux 7 and migrate to an [operating system supported by TiDB](/hardware-and-software-requirements.md#os-and-platform-requirements) for production use, such as Rocky Linux 9.1 or later.

As CentOS Linux 7 has reached EOL, testing of this distribution will be stopped in a future TiDB release.
