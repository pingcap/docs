# TiDB 6.5.2 Release Notes

Release date: April 21, 2023

TiDB version: 6.5.2

Quick access: [Quick start](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/quick-start-with-tidb) | [Production deployment](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/production-deployment-using-tiup) | [Installation packages](https://www.pingcap.com/download/?version=v6.5.2#version-list)

## Compatibility changes

- TiCDC fixes the issue of incorrect encoding of `FLOAT` data in Avro [#8490](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/8490) @[3AceShowHand](https://github.com/3AceShowHand)

    When upgrading the TiCDC cluster to v6.5.2 or a later v6.5.x version, if a table replicated using Avro contains the `FLOAT` data type, you need to manually adjust the compatibility policy of Confluent Schema Registry to `None` before upgrading so that the changefeed can successfully update the schema. Otherwise, after upgrading, the changefeed will be unable to update the schema and enter an error state.

- To fix the potential issue of data loss during replication of partitioned tables to storage services, the default value of the TiCDC [`sink.enable-partition-separator`](/ticdc/ticdc-changefeed-config.md#changefeed-configuration-parameters) configuration item is changed from `false` to `true`. This means that partitions in a table are stored in separate directories by default. It is recommended that you keep the value as `true` to avoid the data loss issue.
