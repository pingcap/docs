# TiDB 4.0.15 Release Notes

Release Date: September 27, 2021

TiDB version: 4.0.15

## Compatibility changes

+ TiDB

    - Fix the issue that executing `SHOW VARIABLES` in a new session is slow. This fix reverts some changes made in [#21045](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/21045) and might cause compatibility issues. [#24326](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/24326)
    + The following bug fixes change execution results, which might cause upgrade incompatibilities:
        - Fix the issue that `greatest(datetime) union null` returns empty string [#26532](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/26532)
        - Fix the issue that the `having` clause might not work correctly [#26496](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/26496)
        - Fix the wrong execution results that occur when the collations around the `between` expression are different [#27146](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/27146)
        - Fix the result wrong that occurs when the argument of the `extract` function is a negative duration [#27236](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/27236)
        - Fix the wrong execution results that occur when the column in the `group_concat` function has a non-bin collation [#27429](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/27429)
        - Fix the issue that column information is missed when converting the `Apply` operator to `Join` [#27233](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/27233)
        - Fix the issue of unexpected behavior when casting the invalid string to `DATE` [#26762](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/26762)
        - Fix a bug that the `count distinct` result on multiple columns is wrong when the new collation is enabled [#27091](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/27091)

## Feature enhancement

+ TiKV

    - Support changing TiCDC configurations dynamically [#10645](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/10645)

## Improvements

+ TiDB

    - Trigger auto-analyze based on the histogram row count [#24237](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/24237)

+ TiKV

    - Handle read ready and write ready separately to reduce read latency [#10475](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/10475)
    - The slow log of TiKV coprocessor only considers the time spent on processing requests. [#10841](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/10841)
    - Drop log instead of blocking threads when the slogger thread is overloaded and the queue is filled up [#10841](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/10841)
    - Reduce the size of Resolved TS messages to save network bandwidth [#2448](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/2448)

+ PD

    - Improve the performance of synchronizing Region information between PDs [#3932](https://github.com/tikv/pd/pull/3932)

+ Tools

    + Backup & Restore (BR)

        - Split and scatter Regions concurrently to improve restore speed [#1363](https://github.com/pingcap/br/pull/1363)
