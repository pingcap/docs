In v5.1, the key new features or improvements are as follows:

- Support the Common Table Expression (CTE) feature of MySQL 8.0 to improve the readability and execution efficiency of SQL statements.
- Support changing column types online to improve code development flexibility.
- Introduce a new statistics type to improve query stability, which is enabled as an experimental feature by default.
- Support the dynamic privilege feature of MySQL 8.0 to implement more fine-grained control over certain operations.
- Support directly reading data from the local replica using the Stale Read feature to reduce read latency and improve query performance (Experimental).
- Add the Lock View feature to facilitate database administrators (DBAs) to observe transaction locking events and troubleshoot deadlock problems (Experimental).
- Add TiKV write rate limiter for background tasks to ensure that the latency of read and write requests is stable.

## Compatibility changes

### Others

- Before the upgrade, check the value of the TiDB configuration [`feedback-probability`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#feedback-probability). If the value is not 0, the "panic in the recoverable goroutine" error will occur after the upgrade, but this error does not affect the upgrade.
- Upgrade the Go compiler version of TiDB from go1.13.7 to go1.16.4, which improves the TiDB performance. If you are a TiDB developer, upgrade your Go compiler version to ensure a smooth compilation. 
- Avoid creating tables with clustered indexes in the cluster that uses TiDB Binlog during the TiDB rolling upgrade.
- Avoid executing statements like `alter table ... modify column` or `alter table ... change column` during the TiDB rolling upgrade.
- Since v5.1, setting the replica of system tables, when building TiFlash replicas for each table, is no longer supported. Before upgrading the cluster, you need to clear the relevant system table replicas; otherwise, the upgrade will fail.
- Deprecate the `--sort-dir` parameter in the `cdc cli changefeed` command of TiCDC. Instead, you can set `--sort-dir` in the `cdc server` command. [#1795](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/pull/1795)
- After upgrading to TiDB 5.1, if TiDB returns the "function READ ONLY has only noop implementation" error, you can let TiDB ignore this error by setting the value of [`tidb_enable_noop_functions`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_noop_functions-new-in-v40) to `ON`. This is because the `read_only` variable in MySQL does not yet take effect in TiDB (which is a 'noop' behavior in TiDB). Therefore, even if this variable is set in TiDB, you can still write data into the TiDB cluster.

## New features

### SQL

- Support the Common Table Expression (CTE) feature of MySQL 8.0.

    This feature empowers TiDB with the capability of querying hierarchical data recursively or non-recursively and meets the needs of using tree queries to implement application logics in multiple sectors such as human resources, manufacturing, financial markets, and education.

    In TiDB, you can apply the `WITH` statement to use Common Table Expressions. [User document](/sql-statements/sql-statement-with.md), [#17472](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/17472)

- Support the dynamic privilege feature of MySQL 8.0.

    Dynamic privileges are used to limit the `SUPER` privilege and provide TiDB with more flexible privilege configuration for more fine-grained access control. For example, you can use dynamic privileges to create a user account that can only perform `BACKUP` and `RESTORE` operations.

    The supported dynamic privileges are as follows:

    - `BACKUP_ADMIN`
    - `RESTORE_ADMIN`
    - `ROLE_ADMIN`
    - `CONNECTION_ADMIN`
    - `SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN`

    You can also use plugins to add new privileges. To check out all supported privileges, execute the `SHOW PRIVILEGES` statement. [User document](/privilege-management.md)

- Add a new configuration item for the Security Enhanced Mode (SEM), which divides the TiDB administrator privileges in a finer-grained way.

    The Security Enhanced Mode is disabled by default. To enable it, see the [user document](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_enhanced_security).

- Enhance the capability of changing column types online. Support changing the column type online using the `ALTER TABLE` statement, including but not limited to:

    - Changing `VARCHAR` to `BIGINT`
    - Modifying the `DECIMAL` precision
    - Compressing the length of `VARCHAR(10)` to `VARCHAR(5)`

    [User document](/sql-statements/sql-statement-modify-column.md)

- Introduce a new SQL syntax `AS OF TIMESTAMP` to perform Stale Read, a new experimental feature used to read historical data from a specified point in time or from a specified time range.

    [User document](/stale-read.md), [#21094](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/21094)

    The examples of `AS OF TIMESTAMP` are as follows:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM t AS OF TIMESTAMP  '2020-09-06 00:00:00';
    START TRANSACTION READ ONLY AS OF TIMESTAMP '2020-09-06 00:00:00';
    SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY as of timestamp '2020-09-06 00:00:00';
    ```

- Introduce a new statistics type `tidb_analyze_version = 2` (Experimental).

    `tidb_analyze_version` is set to `2` by default, which avoids the large errors that might occur in the large data volume caused by hash conflicts in Version 1 and maintains the estimation accuracy in most scenarios.

    [User document](/statistics.md)

### Transaction

+ Support the Lock View feature (Experimental)

    The Lock View feature provides more information about lock conflicts and lock waits of pessimistic locks, which helps DBAs to observe transaction locking conditions and troubleshoot deadlock problems. [#24199](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/24199)

    User document:

    - View the pessimistic locks and other locks that currently occur on all TiKV nodes in the clusters: [`DATA_LOCK_WAITS`](/information-schema/information-schema-data-lock-waits.md)
    - View several deadlock errors that recently occurred on the TiDB nodes: [`DEADLOCKS`](/information-schema/information-schema-deadlocks.md)
    - View the transaction information executed currently on the TiDB nodes: [`TIDB_TRX`](/information-schema/information-schema-tidb-trx.md)

### Performance

+ Stale read of data replicas (Experimental)

    Read local replicas data directly to reduce read latency and improve the query performance
    
    [User document](/stale-read.md), [#21094](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/21094)

+ Enable the Hibernate Region feature by default.

    If a Region is in an inactive state for a long time, it is automatically set to a silent state, which reduces the system overhead of the heartbeat information between the Leader and the Follower.
    
    [User document](/tikv-configuration-file.md#hibernate-regions), [#10266](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/10266)

### Stability

+ Solve the replication stability issue of TiCDC

    - Improve TiCDC memory usage to avoid OOM in the following scenarios
    - If large amounts of data is accumulated during the replication interruption, exceeding 1TB, the re-replication causes OOM problems.
    - Large amounts of data writes cause OOM problems in TiCDC.
    - Reduce the possibility of  TiCDC replication interruption in the following scenarios:
        
        [project#11](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/projects/11)

        - Replication interruption when the network is unstable
        - Replication interruption when some TiKV/PD/TiCDC nodes are down

+ TiFlash storage memory control

    Optimize the speed and memory usage of Region snapshot generation and reduce the possibility of OOM

+ Add a write rate limiter for TiKV background tasks (TiKV Write Rate Limiter)

    To ensure the duration stability of read and write requests, TiKV Write Rate Limiter smoothes the write traffic of TiKV background tasks such as GC and Compaction. The default value of TiKV background task write rate limiter is "0MB". It is recommended to set this value to the optimal I/O bandwidth of the disk, such as the maximum I/O bandwidth specified by the cloud disk manufacturer.
    
    [User document](/tikv-configuration-file.md#storageio-rate-limit), [#9156](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/9156)

+ Solve scheduling stability issues when multiple scaling tasks are performed at the same time

### Telemetry

TiDB adds the running status of TiDB cluster requests in telemetry, including execution status, failure status, etc.

To learn more about the information and how to disable this behavior, refer to [Telemetry](/telemetry.md).
