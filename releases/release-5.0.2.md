# TiDB 5.0.2 Release Notes

Release date: June 10, 2021

TiDB version: 5.0.2

## Compatibility Changes

+ Tools

    + TiCDC

        - Deprecate `--sort-dir` in the `cdc cli changefeed` command. Instead, users can set `--sort-dir` in the `cdc server` command. [#1795](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/pull/1795)

## New Features

+ TiKV

    - Enable the Hibernate Region feature by default [#10266](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/10266)

## Improvements

+ TiDB

    - Avoid frequently reading the `mysql.stats_histograms` table if the cached statistics is up-to-date to avoid high CPU usage [#24317](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/24317)

+ TiKV

    - BR now supports the S3-compatible storage using the virtual-host addressing mode [#10243](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/10243)
    - Support the back pressure for TiCDC's scan speed [#10151](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/10151)
    - Reduce the memory usage of TiCDC's initial scan [#10133](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/10133)
    - Improve the cache hit ratio of the TiCDC's Old Value feature in the pessimistic transaction [#10089](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/10089)
    - Split Regions more evenly to mitigate the issue that the growth of Region size exceeds the splitting speed when there are hotspot writes [#9785](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/9785)

+ TiFlash

    - Optimize the table lock to prevent DDL jobs and data reads from blocking each other
    - Support casting the `INTEGER` or `REAL` type to `REAL` type

        - Delete some useless log information that might cause user confusion [#1759](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/pull/1759)

    + Backup & Restore (BR)

        - Clarify some ambiguous error messages [#1132](https://github.com/pingcap/br/pull/1132)
        - Support checking the cluster version of a backup [#1091](https://github.com/pingcap/br/pull/1091)
