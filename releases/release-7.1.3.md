# TiDB 7.1.3 Release Notes

Release date: December 21, 2023

TiDB version: 7.1.3

Quick access: [Quick start](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.1/quick-start-with-tidb) | [Production deployment](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.1/production-deployment-using-tiup) | [Installation packages](https://www.pingcap.com/download/?version=v7.1.3#version-list)

## Compatibility changes

- After further testing, the default value of the TiCDC Changefeed configuration item [`case-sensitive`](/ticdc/ticdc-changefeed-config.md) is changed from `true` to `false`. This means that by default, table and database names in the TiCDC configuration file are case-insensitive [#10047](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/10047) @[sdojjy](https://github.com/sdojjy)
- TiCDC Changefeed introduces the following new configuration items:
    - [`sql-mode`](/ticdc/ticdc-changefeed-config.md): enables you to set the [SQL mode](/ticdc/ticdc-ddl.md#sql-mode) used by TiCDC to parse DDL statements when TiCDC replicates data [#9876](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/9876) @[asddongmen](https://github.com/asddongmen)
    - [`encoding-worker-num`](/ticdc/ticdc-changefeed-config.md) and [`flush-worker-num`](/ticdc/ticdc-changefeed-config.md): enables you to set different concurrency parameters for the redo module based on specifications of different machines [#10048](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/10048) @[CharlesCheung96](https://github.com/CharlesCheung96)
    - [`compression`](/ticdc/ticdc-changefeed-config.md): enables you to configure the compression behavior of redo log files [#10176](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/10176) @[sdojjy](https://github.com/sdojjy)
    - [`sink.cloud-storage-config`](/ticdc/ticdc-changefeed-config.md): enables you to set the automatic cleanup of historical data when replicating data to object storage [#10109](https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow/issues/10109) @[CharlesCheung96](https://github.com/CharlesCheung96)
