Release Date: July 30, 2021

TiDB version: 5.1.1

## Compatibility changes

+ TiDB

    - For TiDB clusters upgrade from v4.0 to v5.1, the default value of `tidb_multi_statement_mode` is `OFF`. It is recommended to use the multi-statement feature of your client library instead. See [the documentation on `tidb_multi_statement_mode`](/system-variables.md#tidb_multi_statement_mode-new-in-v4011) for details. [#25751](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/25751)
    - Change the default value of the `tidb_stmt_summary_max_stmt_count` variable from `200` to `3000` [#25874](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/25874)
    - Require the `SUPER` privilege to access the `table_storage_stats` table [#26352](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/26352)
    - Require the `SELECT` privilege on `mysql.user` to access the `information_schema.user_privileges` table to show other user's privileges [#26311](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/26311)
    - Require the `CONFIG` privilege to access the `information_schema.cluster_hardware` table [#26297](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/26297)
