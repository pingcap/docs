## Feature details

### Scalability

* Setting the memory limit for schema cache is now generally available (GA). When the number of tables reaches hundreds of thousands or even millions, this feature significantly reduces the memory usage of schema metadata [#50959](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/50959) @[tiancaiamao](https://github.com/tiancaiamao) @[wjhuang2016](https://github.com/wjhuang2016) @[gmhdbjd](https://github.com/gmhdbjd) @[tangenta](https://github.com/tangenta)

    In some SaaS scenarios, where the number of tables reaches hundreds of thousands or even millions, schema metadata can consume a significant amount of memory. With this feature enabled, TiDB uses the Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm to cache and evict the corresponding schema metadata, effectively reducing memory usage.

    Starting from v8.4.0, this feature is enabled by default with a default value of `536870912` (that is, 512 MiB). You can adjust it as needed using the variable [`tidb_schema_cache_size`](/system-variables.md#tidb_schema_cache_size-new-in-v800).

    For more information, see [documentation](/schema-cache.md).

* Provide the Active PD Follower feature to enhance the scalability of PD's Region information query service (GA) [#7431](https://github.com/tikv/pd/issues/7431) @[okJiang](https://github.com/okJiang)

    In a TiDB cluster with a large number of Regions, the PD leader might experience high CPU load due to the increased overhead of handling heartbeats and scheduling tasks. If the cluster has many TiDB instances, and there is a high concurrency of requests for Region information, the CPU pressure on the PD leader increases further and might cause PD services to become unavailable.

    To ensure high availability, TiDB v7.6.0 introduces Active PD Follower as an experimental feature to enhance the scalability of PD's Region information query service. In v8.5.0, this feature becomes generally available (GA). You can enable the Active PD Follower feature by setting the system variable [`pd_enable_follower_handle_region`](/system-variables.md#pd_enable_follower_handle_region-new-in-v760) to `ON`. After this feature is enabled, TiDB evenly distributes Region information requests to all PD servers, and PD followers can also handle Region requests, thereby reducing the CPU pressure on the PD leader.

    For more information, see [documentation](/tune-region-performance.md#use-the-active-pd-follower-feature-to-enhance-the-scalability-of-pds-region-information-query-service).

### Performance

* TiDB accelerated table creation becomes generally available (GA), significantly reducing data migration and cluster initialization time [#50052](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/50052) @[D3Hunter](https://github.com/D3Hunter) @[gmhdbjd](https://github.com/gmhdbjd)

    TiDB v7.6.0 introduces accelerated table creation as an experimental feature, controlled by the system variable [`tidb_ddl_version`](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.6/system-variables#tidb_ddl_version-new-in-v760). Staring from v8.0.0, this system variable is renamed to [`tidb_enable_fast_create_table`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_fast_create_table-new-in-v800).

    In v8.5.0, TiDB accelerated table creation becomes generally available (GA) and is enabled by default. During data migration and cluster initialization, this feature supports rapid creation of millions of tables, significantly reducing operation time.

    For more information, see [documentation](/accelerated-table-creation.md).

* TiKV supports the MVCC in-memory engine (IME), which accelerates queries involving scans of extensive MVCC historical versions [#16141](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/16141) @[SpadeA-Tang](https://github.com/SpadeA-Tang) @[glorv](https://github.com/glorv) @[overvenus](https://github.com/overvenus)

    When records are frequently updated, or TiDB is required to retain historical versions for extended periods (for example, 24 hours), the accumulation of MVCC versions can degrade scan performance. The TiKV MVCC in-memory engine improves scan performance by caching the latest MVCC versions in memory, and using a rapid GC mechanism to remove historical versions from memory.

    Starting from v8.5.0, TiKV introduces MVCC in-memory engine. If the accumulation of MVCC versions in the TiKV cluster leads to degraded scan performance, you can enable the TiKV MVCC in-memory engine to improve scan performance by setting the TiKV configuration parameter [`in-memory-engine.enable`](/tikv-in-memory-engine.md#usage).

    For more information, see [documentation](/tikv-in-memory-engine.md).

### Reliability

* Support limiting the maximum rate and concurrency of requests processed by PD [#5739](https://github.com/tikv/pd/issues/5739) @[rleungx](https://github.com/rleungx)

    When a sudden influx of requests is sent to PD, it can lead to high workloads and potentially affect PD performance. Starting from v8.5.0, you can use [`pd-ctl`](/pd-control.md) to limit the maximum rate and concurrency of requests processed by PD, improving its stability.

    For more information, see [documentation](/pd-control.md).

### SQL

* Support foreign keys (GA) [#36982](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/36982) @[YangKeao](https://github.com/YangKeao) @[crazycs520](https://github.com/crazycs520)

    The foreign key feature becomes generally available (GA) in v8.5.0. Foreign key constraints help ensure data consistency and integrity. You can easily establish foreign key relationships between tables, with support for cascading updates and deletions, simplifying data management. This feature enhances support for applications with complex data relationships.

    For more information, see [documentation](/foreign-key.md).

* Introduce the `ADMIN ALTER DDL JOBS` statement to support modifying the DDL jobs online [#57229](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/57229) @[fzzf678](https://github.com/fzzf678) @[tangenta](https://github.com/tangenta)

    Starting from v8.3.0, you can set the variables [`tidb_ddl_reorg_batch_size`](/system-variables.md#tidb_ddl_reorg_batch_size) and [`tidb_ddl_reorg_worker_cnt`](/system-variables.md#tidb_ddl_reorg_worker_cnt) at the session level. As a result, setting these two variables globally no longer affects all running DDL jobs. To modify the values of these variables, you need to cancel the DDL job first, adjust the variables, and then resubmit the job.

    TiDB v8.5.0 introduces the `ADMIN ALTER DDL JOBS` statement, letting you adjust the variable values of specific DDL jobs online. This enables flexible balancing of resource consumption and performance. The changes are limited to individual jobs, making the impact more controllable. For example:

    - `ADMIN ALTER DDL JOBS job_id THREAD = 8;`: adjusts the `tidb_ddl_reorg_worker_cnt` of the specified DDL job online.
    - `ADMIN ALTER DDL JOBS job_id BATCH_SIZE = 256;`: adjusts the `tidb_ddl_reorg_batch_size` of the specified job online.
    - `ADMIN ALTER DDL JOBS job_id MAX_WRITE_SPEED = '200MiB';`: adjusts the write traffic of index data to each TiKV node online.

  For more information, see [documentation](/sql-statements/sql-statement-admin-alter-ddl.md).

### Security

* BR supports client-side encryption of both full backup data and log backup data (GA) [#28640](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/28640) [#56433](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/56433) @[joccau](https://github.com/joccau) @[Tristan1900](https://github.com/Tristan1900)

    * Client-side encryption of full backup data (introduced as experimental in TiDB v5.3.0) enables you to encrypt backup data on the client side using a custom fixed key.

    * Client-side encryption of log backup data (introduced as experimental in TiDB v8.4.0) enables you to encrypt log backup data on the client side using one of the following methods:

        * Encrypt using a custom fixed key
        * Encrypt using a master key stored on a local disk
        * Encrypt using a master key managed by a Key Management Service (KMS)

  Starting from v8.5.0, both encryption features become generally available (GA), offering enhanced client-side data security.

    For more information, see [Encrypt the backup data](/br/br-snapshot-manual.md#encrypt-the-backup-data) and [Encrypt the log backup data](/br/br-pitr-manual.md#encrypt-the-log-backup-data).

* TiKV encryption at rest supports [Google Cloud Key Management Service (Google Cloud KMS)](https://cloud.google.com/docs/security/key-management-deep-dive) (GA) [#8906](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/8906) @[glorv](https://github.com/glorv)

    TiKV ensures data security by using the encryption at rest technique to encrypt stored data. The core aspect of this technique is proper key management. In v8.0.0, TiKV encryption at rest experimentally supports using Google Cloud KMS for master key management.

    Starting from v8.5.0, encryption at rest using Google Cloud KMS becomes generally available (GA). To use this feature, first create a key on Google Cloud, and then configure the `[security.encryption.master-key]` section in the TiKV configuration file.

    For more information, see [documentation](/encryption-at-rest.md#tikv-encryption-at-rest).

## Compatibility changes

> **Note:**
>
> This section provides compatibility changes you need to know when you upgrade from v8.4.0 to the current version (v8.5.0). If you are upgrading from v8.3.0 or earlier versions to the current version, you might also need to check the compatibility changes introduced in intermediate versions.

### Behavior changes

- In non-strict mode (`sql_mode = ''`), inserting `NULL` values into non-`NULL` columns now returns an error for MySQL compatibility. [#55457](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/55457) @[joechenrh](https://github.com/joechenrh)
- The `ALTER TABLE ... DROP FOREIGN KEY IF EXISTS ...` statement is no longer supported. [#56703](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/56703) @[YangKeao](https://github.com/YangKeao)

### System variables

| Variable name | Change type | Description |
|--------|------------------------------|------|
| [`tidb_enable_fast_create_table`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_fast_create_table-new-in-v800) | Modified | Changes the default value from `OFF` to `ON` after further tests, meaning that the [accelerated table creation](/accelerated-table-creation.md) feature is enabled by default. |
| [`tidb_ddl_reorg_max_write_speed`](/system-variables.md#tidb_ddl_reorg_max_write_speed-new-in-v850)  | Newly added | Limits the write bandwidth for each TiKV node and only takes effect when index creation acceleration is enabled (controlled by the [`tidb_ddl_enable_fast_reorg`](/system-variables.md#tidb_ddl_enable_fast_reorg-new-in-v630) variable). For example, setting the variable to `200MiB` limits the maximum write speed to 200 MiB/s.  |

| BR | [`--checksum`](/br/br-snapshot-manual.md) | Modified | Changes the default value from `true` to `false`, meaning that BR does not calculate the table-level checksum during full backups by default, to improve backup performance. |

## Operating system and platform requirement changes

Before upgrading TiDB, ensure that your operating system version meets the [OS and platform requirements](/hardware-and-software-requirements.md#os-and-platform-requirements).

- According to [CentOS Linux EOL](https://www.centos.org/centos-linux-eol/), the upstream support for CentOS Linux 7 ends on June 30, 2024. TiDB ends the support for CentOS 7 starting from the 8.4 DMR version. It is recommended to use Rocky Linux 9.1 or a later version. Upgrading a TiDB cluster on CentOS 7 to v8.4.0 or later will cause the cluster to become unavailable.
- According to [Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/#Life_Cycle_Dates), the maintenance support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 ends on June 30, 2024. TiDB ends the support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 starting from the 8.4 DMR version. It is recommended to use Rocky Linux 9.1 or a later version. Upgrading a TiDB cluster on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 to v8.4.0 or later will cause the cluster to become unavailable.

## Removed features

* The following feature has been removed:

    * In v8.4.0, [TiDB Binlog](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.3/tidb-binlog-overview) is removed. Starting from v8.3.0, TiDB Binlog is fully deprecated. For incremental data replication, use [TiCDC](/ticdc/ticdc-overview.md) instead. For point-in-time recovery (PITR), use [PITR](/br/br-pitr-guide.md). Before you upgrade your TiDB cluster to v8.4.0 or later versions, be sure to switch to TiCDC and PITR.

* The following features are planned for removal in future versions:

    * Starting from v8.0.0, TiDB Lightning deprecates the [old version of conflict detection](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode-usage.md#the-old-version-of-conflict-detection-deprecated-in-v800) strategy for the physical import mode, and enables you to control the conflict detection strategy for both logical and physical import modes via the [`conflict.strategy`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task) parameter. The [`duplicate-resolution`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md) parameter for the old version of conflict detection will be removed in a future release.

## Deprecated features

The following features are planned for deprecation in future versions:

* In v8.0.0, TiDB introduces the [`tidb_enable_auto_analyze_priority_queue`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_auto_analyze_priority_queue-new-in-v800) system variable to control whether priority queues are enabled to optimize the ordering of tasks that automatically collect statistics. In future releases, the priority queue will be the only way to order tasks for automatically collecting statistics, so this system variable will be deprecated.
* In v7.5.0, TiDB introduces the [`tidb_enable_async_merge_global_stats`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_async_merge_global_stats-new-in-v750) system variable. You can use it to set TiDB to use asynchronous merging of partition statistics to avoid OOM issues. In future releases, partition statistics will be merged asynchronously, so this system variable will be deprecated.
* It is planned to redesign [the automatic evolution of execution plan bindings](/sql-plan-management.md#baseline-evolution) in subsequent releases, and the related variables and behavior will change.
* In v8.0.0, TiDB introduces the [`tidb_enable_parallel_hashagg_spill`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_parallel_hashagg_spill-new-in-v800) system variable to control whether TiDB supports disk spill for the concurrent HashAgg algorithm. In future versions, this system variable will be deprecated.
* In v5.1, TiDB introduces the [`tidb_partition_prune_mode`](/system-variables.md#tidb_partition_prune_mode-new-in-v51) system variable to control whether to enable the dynamic pruning mode for partitioned tables. Starting from v8.5.0, a warning is returned when you set this variable to `static` or `static-only`. In future versions, this system variable will be deprecated.
* The TiDB Lightning parameter [`conflict.max-record-rows`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task) is planned for deprecation in a future release and will be subsequently removed. This parameter will be replaced by [`conflict.threshold`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task), which means that the maximum number of conflicting records is consistent with the maximum number of conflicting records that can be tolerated in a single import task.
* Starting from v6.3.0, partitioned tables use [dynamic pruning mode](/partitioned-table.md#dynamic-pruning-mode) by default. Compared with static pruning mode, dynamic pruning mode supports features such as IndexJoin and plan cache with better performance. Therefore, static pruning mode will be deprecated.
