# TiDB 2.1.19 Release Notes

Release date: December 27, 2019

TiDB version: 2.1.19

TiDB Ansible version: 2.1.19

## TiDB

+ SQL Optimizer
    - Optimize the scenario of `select max(_tidb_rowid) from t` to avoid full table scan [#13294](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13294)
    - Fix the incorrect results caused by the incorrect value assigned to the user variable in the query and the push-down of predicates [#13230](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13230)
    - Fix the issue that the statistics are not accurate because a data race occurs when statistics are updated [#13690](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13690)
    - Fix the issue that the result is incorrect when the `UPDATE` statement contains both a sub-query and a stored generated column; fix the `UPDATE` statement execution error when this statement contains two same-named tables from different databases [#13357](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13357)
    - Fix the issue that the query plan might be incorrectly selected because the `PhysicalUnionScan` operator incorrectly sets the statistics [#14134](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14134)
    - Remove the `minAutoAnalyzeRatio` constraint to make the automatic `ANALYZE` more timely [#14013](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14013)
    - Fix the issue that the estimated number of rows is greater than `1` when the `WHERE` clause contains an equal condition on the unique key [#13385](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13385)
+ SQL Execution Engine
    - Fix the precision overflow when using `int64` as the intermediate result of `unit64` in `ConvertJSONToInt` [#13036](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13036)
    - Fix the issue that when the `SLEEP` function is in a query (for example, `select 1 from (select sleep(1)) t;)`), column pruning causes `sleep(1)` in the query to be invalid [#13039](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13039)
    - Reduce memory overhead by reusing `Chunk` in the `INSERT ON DUPLICATE UPDATE` statement [#12999](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12999)
    - Add more transaction-related fields for the `slow_query` table [#13129](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13129):
        - `Prewrite_time`
        - `Commit_time`
        - `Get_commit_ts_time`
        - `Commit_backoff_time`
        - `Backoff_types`
        - `Resolve_lock_time`
        - `Local_latch_wait_time`

        - `Write_size`
        - `Prewrite_region`
        - `Txn_retry`

    - Support executing `ADMIN CHECK TABLE` on partitioned tables [#13143](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13143)
    - Fix the issue that the precision of statements such as `SHOW CREATE TABLE` is incomplete when `ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` is used as a column attribute and floating point precision is specified [#12462](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/12462)
    - Fix the panic occurred when executing the `SELECT * FROM information_schema.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE` statement because the foreign key is not checked when dropping, modifying or changing the column [#14162](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14162)
    - Fix the issue that the returned data might be duplicated when `Streaming` is enabled in TiDB [#13255](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13255)
    - Fix the `Invalid time format` error caused by daylight saving time [#13624](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13624)

    - Fix the issue that an error might occur when converting the string type to the floating point type in the `INSERT` statement execution [#14009](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/14009)

    - Fix the issue that `data too long` is returned when `CAST` converting the data in `union` of the same location to the merged type because the returned type length of the `jsonUnquoteFunction` function is given an incorrect value [#13645](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13645)
    - Fix the issue that the password cannot be set because the privilege check is too strict [#13805](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13805)

    - Check the width range of the `BIT` column [#13511](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13511)
    - Make the error information output from `change/modify column` more understandable [#13798](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/13798)
