# TiDB Specific System Variables

TiDB contains a number of system variables which are specific to its usage, and **do not** apply to MySQL. These variables start with a `tidb_` prefix, and can be tuned to optimize system performance.

## System variables

Variables can be set with the `SET` statement, for example:

```
set @@tidb_distsql_scan_concurrency = 10
```

If you need to set the global variable, run:

```
set @@global.tidb_distsql_scan_concurrency = 10
```

### tidb_snapshot

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: ""
- This variable is used to set the time point at which the data is read by the session. For example, when you set the variable to "2017-11-11 20:20:20" or a TSO number like "400036290571534337", the current session reads the data of this moment.

### tidb_import_data

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 0
- This variable indicates whether to import data from the dump file currently.
- To speed up importing, the unique index constraint is not checked when the variable is set to 1.
- This variable is only used by Lightning. Do not modify it.

### tidb_opt_agg_push_down

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 0
- This variable is used to set whether the optimizer executes the optimization operation of pushing down the aggregate function to the position before Join.
- When the aggregate operation is slow in query, you can set the variable value to 1.

### tidb_auto_analyze_ratio

- Scope: GLOBAL
- Default value: 0.5
- This variable is used to set the threshold when TiDB automatically executes [`ANALYZE TABLE`](/dev/reference/sql/statements/analyze-table.md) in a background thread to update table statistics. For example, a value of 0.5 means that auto-analyze is triggered when greater than 50% of the rows in a table have been modified. Auto-analyze can be restricted to only execute during certain hours of the day by specifying `tidb_auto_analyze_start_time` and `tidb_auto_analyze_end_time`.

> **Note:**
>
> Only when the `run-auto-analyze` option is enabled in the starting configuration file of TiDB, the `auto_analyze` feature can be triggered.

### tidb_auto_analyze_start_time

- Scope: GLOBAL
- Default value: 00:00 +0000
- This variable is used to restrict the time window that the automatic update of statistics is permitted. For example, to only allow automatic statistics updates between 1AM and 3AM, set `tidb_auto_analyze_start_time='01:00 +0000'` and `tidb_auto_analyze_end_time='03:00 +0000'`.

### tidb_auto_analyze_end_time

- Scope: GLOBAL
- Default value: 23:59 +0000
- This variable is used to restrict the time window that the automatic update of statistics is permitted. For example, to only allow automatic statistics updates between 1AM and 3AM, set `tidb_auto_analyze_start_time='01:00 +0000'` and `tidb_auto_analyze_end_time='03:00 +0000'`.

### tidb_build_stats_concurrency

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 4
- This variable is used to set the concurrency of executing the `ANALYZE` statement.
- When the variable is set to a larger value, the execution performance of other queries is affected.

### tidb_checksum_table_concurrency

- Use a bigger value in OLAP scenarios, and a smaller value in OLTP scenarios.
- For OLAP scenarios, the maximum value cannot exceed the number of CPU cores of all the TiKV nodes.

### tidb_index_lookup_size

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 20000
- This variable is used to set the batch size of the `index lookup` operation.
- Use a bigger value in OLAP scenarios, and a smaller value in OLTP scenarios.

### tidb_hashagg_partial_concurrency

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 4
- This variable is used to set the concurrency of executing the concurrent `hash aggregation` algorithm in the `partial` phase.
- When the parameter of the aggregate function is not distinct, `HashAgg` is run concurrently and respectively in two phases - the `partial` phase and the `final` phase.

### tidb_hashagg_final_concurrency

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 4
- This variable is used to set the concurrency of executing the concurrent `hash aggregation` algorithm in the `final` phase.
- When the parameter of the aggregate function is not distinct, `HashAgg` is run concurrently and respectively in two phases - the `partial` phase and the `final` phase.

### tidb_index_join_batch_size

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 25000

### tidb_skip_utf8_check

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 0
- This variable is used to set whether to skip UTF-8 validation.
- Validating UTF-8 characters affects the performance. When you are sure that the input characters are valid UTF-8 characters, you can set the variable value to 1.

### tidb_batch_insert

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 0
- This variable is used to set whether to divide the inserted data automatically. It is valid only when `autocommit` is enabled.
- When inserting a large amount of data, you can set the variable value to `1`. Then, the inserted data is automatically divided into multiple batches and each batch is inserted by a single transaction. This operation breaks the atomicity and isolation of the transaction. When performing this operation, you must ensure that there are **no other** ongoing operations on the table. When an error occurs, **manual intervention is required to check the consistency and integrity of the data**. Therefore, it is not recommended to set this variable in a production environment.

### tidb_batch_delete

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 0
- This variable is used to set whether to divide the data for deletion automatically. It is valid only when you delete from a single table and `autocommit` is enabled. For the definition of single-table DELETE statement, see [DELETE Syntax](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/delete.html).
- When deleting a large amount of data, you can set the variable value to `1`. Then, the data for deletion is automatically divided into multiple batches and each batch is deleted by a single transaction. This operation breaks the atomicity and isolation of the transaction. When performing this operation, you must ensure that there are **no other** ongoing operations on the table. When an error occurs, **manual intervention is required to check the consistency and integrity of the data**. Therefore, it is not recommended to set this variable in a production environment.

### tidb_dml_batch_size

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 20000
- This variable is used to set the automatically divided batch size of the data for insertion/deletion. It is only valid when `tidb_batch_insert` or `tidb_batch_delete` is enabled.
- When the data size of a single row is very large, the overall data size of 20 thousand rows exceeds the size limit for a single transaction. In this case, set the variable to a smaller value.

### tidb_init_chunk_size

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 32
- This variable is used to set the number of rows for the initial chunk during the execution process.

### tidb_max_chunk_size

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 1024
- This variable is used to set the maximum number of rows in a chunk during the execution process.

### tidb_mem_quota_query

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 32 GB
- This variable is used to set the threshold value of memory quota for a query.
- If the memory quota of a query during execution exceeds the threshold value, TiDB performs the operation designated by the OOMAction option in the configuration file.

### tidb_mem_quota_hashjoin

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 32 GB
- This variable is used to set the threshold value of memory quota for the `HashJoin` operator.
- If the memory quota of the `HashJoin` operator during execution exceeds the threshold value, TiDB performs the operation designated by the OOMAction option in the configuration file.

### tidb_mem_quota_mergejoin

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 32 GB
- This variable is used to set the threshold value of memory quota for the `MergeJoin` operator.
- If the memory quota of the `MergeJoin` operator during execution exceeds the threshold value, TiDB performs the operation designated by the OOMAction option in the configuration file.

### tidb_mem_quota_sort

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 32 GB
- This variable is used to set the threshold value of memory quota for the `Sort` operator.
- If the memory quota of the `Sort` operator during execution exceeds the threshold value, TiDB performs the operation designated by the OOMAction option in the configuration file.

### tidb_mem_quota_topn

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 32 GB
- This variable is used to set the threshold value of memory quota for the `TopN` operator.
- If the memory quota of the `TopN` operator during execution exceeds the threshold value, TiDB performs the operation designated by the OOMAction option in the configuration file.

### tidb_mem_quota_indexlookupreader

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 32 GB
- This variable is used to set the threshold value of memory quota for the `IndexLookupReader` operator.
- If the memory quota of the `IndexLookupReader` operator during execution exceeds the threshold value, TiDB performs the operation designated by the OOMAction option in the configuration file.

### tidb_mem_quota_indexlookupjoin

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 32 GB
- This variable is used to set the threshold value of memory quota for the `IndexLookupJoin` operator.
- If the memory quota of the `IndexLookupJoin` operator during execution exceeds the threshold value, TiDB performs the operation designated by the OOMAction option in the configuration file.

### tidb_mem_quota_nestedloopapply

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 32 GB
- This variable is used to set the threshold value of memory quota for the `NestedLoopApply` operator.
- If the memory quota of the `NestedLoopApply` operator during execution exceeds the threshold value, TiDB performs the operation designated by the OOMAction option in the configuration file.

### tidb_general_log

- Scope: SERVER
- Default value: 0
- This variable is used to set whether to record all the SQL statements in the log.

### tidb_enable_streaming

- Scope: SERVER
- Default value: 0
- This variable is used to set whether to enable Streaming.

### tidb_retry_limit

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 10
- When a transaction encounters retryable errors (such as transaction conflicts, over slow transaction commit, or table schema changes), this transaction can be re-executed. This variable is used to set the maximum number of the retries.

### tidb_disable_txn_auto_retry

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default: on
- This variable is used to set whether to disable automatic retry of explicit transactions. The default value of `on` means that transactions will not automatically retry in TiDB and `COMMIT` statements might return errors that need to be handled in the application layer.

    Setting the value to `off` means that TiDB will automatically retry transactions, resulting in fewer errors from `COMMIT` statements. Be careful when making this change, because it might result in lost updates.

    This variable does not affect automatically committed implicit transactions and internally executed transactions in TiDB. The maximum retry count of these transactions is determined by the value of `tidb_retry_limit`.

    To decide whether you can enable automatic retry, see [description of optimistic transactions](/dev/reference/transactions/transaction-isolation.md#transaction-retry).

### tidb_backoff_weight

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 2
- This variable is used to increase the weight of the maximum time of TiDB `backoff`, that is, the maximum retry time for sending a retry request when an internal network or other component (TiKV, PD) failure is encountered. This variable can be used to adjust the maximum retry time and the minimum value is 1.

    For example, the base timeout for TiDB to take TSO from PD is 15 seconds. When `tidb_backoff_weight = 2`, the maximum timeout for taking TSO is: *base time * 2 = 30 seconds*.

    In the case of a poor network environment, appropriately increasing the value of this variable can effectively alleviate error reporting to the application end caused by timeout. If the application end wants to receive the error information more quickly, minimize the value of this variable.

### tidb_enable_table_partition

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: "auto"
- This variable is used to set whether to enable the `TABLE PARTITION` feature.
    - `off` indicates disabling the `TABLE PARTITION` feature. In this case, the syntax that creates a partition table can be executed, but the table created is not a partitioned one.
    - `auto` indicates enabling the `TABLE PARTITION` feature. Currently, it indicates enabling range partition and hash partition.
    - `on` functions the same way as `auto` does.
- Currently, TiDB only supports range partition and hash partition.

### tidb_backoff_lock_fast

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 100
- This variable is used to set the `backoff` time when the read request meets a lock.

### tidb_ddl_reorg_worker_cnt

- Scope: GLOBAL
- Default value: 16
- This variable is used to set the concurrency of the DDL operation in the `re-organize` phase.

### tidb_ddl_reorg_batch_size

- Scope: GLOBAL
- Default value: 1024
- This variable is used to set the batch size during the `re-organize` phase of the DDL operation. For example, when TiDB executes the `ADD INDEX` operation, the index data needs to backfilled by `tidb_ddl_reorg_worker_cnt` (the number) concurrent workers. Each worker backfills the index data in batches.
    - If many updating operations such as `UPDATE` and `REPLACE` exist during the `ADD INDEX` operation, a larger batch size indicates a larger probability of transaction conflicts. In this case, you need to adjust the batch size to a smaller value. The minimum value is 32.
    - If the transaction conflict does not exist, you can set the batch size to a large value. The maximum value is 10240. This can increase the speed of the backfilling data, but the write pressure on TiKV also becomes higher.

### tidb_ddl_reorg_priority

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: `PRIORITY_LOW`
- This variable is used to set the priority of executing the `ADD INDEX` operation in the `re-organize` phase.
- You can set the value of this variable to `PRIORITY_LOW`, `PRIORITY_NORMAL` or `PRIORITY_HIGH`.

### tidb_ddl_error_count_limit

- Scope: GLOBAL
- Default value: 512
- This variable is used to set the number of retries when the DDL operation fails. When the number of retries exceeds the parameter value, the wrong DDL operation is canceled.

### tidb_force_priority

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: `NO_PRIORITY`
- This variable is used to change the default priority for statements executed on a TiDB server. A use case is to ensure that a particular user that is performing OLAP queries receives lower priority than users performing OLTP queries.
- You can set the value of this variable to `NO_PRIORITY`, `LOW_PRIORITY`, `DELAYED` or `HIGH_PRIORITY`.

### tidb_opt_write_row_id

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 0
- This variable is used to set whether to allow `insert`, `replace` and `update` statements to operate on the column `_tidb_rowid`. It is not allowed by default. This variable can be used only when importing data with TiDB tools.

## SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS

For the tables with non-integer PK or without PK, TiDB uses an implicit auto-increment ROW ID. When a large number of `INSERT` operations occur, the data is written into a single Region, causing a write hot spot.

To mitigate the hot spot issue, you can configure `SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS`. The ROW ID is scattered and the data is written into multiple different Regions. But setting an overlarge value might lead to an excessively large number of RPC requests, which increases the CPU and network overheads.

- `SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS = 4` indicates 16 shards
- `SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS = 6` indicates 64 shards
- `SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS = 0` indicates the default 1 shard

Usage of statements:

- `CREATE TABLE`: `CREATE TABLE t (c int) SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS = 4;`
- `ALTER TABLE`: `ALTER TABLE t SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS = 4;`

## tidb_slow_log_threshold

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 300ms
- This variable is used to output the threshold value of the time consumed by the slow log. When the time consumed by a query is larger than this value, this query is considered as a slow log and its log is output to the slow query log.

Usage example:

```sql
set tidb_slow_log_threshold = 200
```

## tidb_query_log_max_len

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 2048 (bytes)
- The maximum length of the SQL statement output. When the output length of a statement is larger than the `tidb_query-log-max-len` value, the statement is truncated to output.

Usage example:

```sql
set tidb_query_log_max_len = 20
```

### tidb_txn_mode

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL (in TiDB 3.0.4 or later)
- Default value: ""
- This variable is used to set the transaction mode, which by default is optimistic locking mode. TiDB 3.0 supports the pessimistic locking mode (experimental). After you set `tidb_txn_mode` to `pessimistic`, all explicit transactions (non-autocommit transactions) the session executes become pessimistic transactions.
- Since TiDB 3.0.4, you can also use this variable to set the transaction mode globally. Once set to GLOBAL, only sessions created after modification are affected. For details, see [TiDB Pessimistic Transaction Mode](/dev/reference/transactions/transaction-pessimistic.md).

### tidb_constraint_check_in_place

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 0
- TiDB uses the optimistic locking model by default. This means that conflict check (unique key check) is performed when the transaction is committed. This variable is used to set whether to do a unique key check each time a row of data is written.
- If this variable is enabled, the performance might be affected in a scenario where a large batch of data is written. For example:

    - When this variable is disabled:

        ```sql
        tidb >create table t (i int key)
        tidb >insert into t values (1);
        tidb >begin
        tidb >insert into t values (1);
        Query OK, 1 row affected
        tidb >commit; -- Check only when a transaction is committed.
        ERROR 1062 : Duplicate entry '1' for key 'PRIMARY'
        ```

    - After this variable is enabled:

        ```sql
        tidb >set @@tidb_constraint_check_in_place=1
        tidb >begin
        tidb >insert into t values (1);
        ERROR 1062 : Duplicate entry '1' for key 'PRIMARY'
        ```

### tidb_check_mb4_value_in_utf8

- Scope: SERVER
- Default value: 1, indicating check the validity of UTF-8 data. This default behavior is compatible with MySQL.
- This variable is used to set whether to check the validity of UTF-8 data.
- To upgrade an earlier version (TiDB v2.1.1 or earlier), you may need to disable this option. Otherwise, you can successfully write invalid strings in an earlier version but fail to do this in a later version, because there is no data validity check in the earlier version. For details, see [FAQs After Upgrade](/dev/faq/upgrade.md).

### tidb_opt_insubq_to_join_and_agg

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 1
- This variable is used to set whether to enable the optimization rule that converts a subquery to join and aggregation.
- For example, after you enable this optimization rule, the subquery is converted as follows:

    ```sql
    select * from t where t.a in (select aa from t1)
    ```

    The subquery is converted to join as follows:

    ```sql
    select * from t, (select aa from t1 group by aa) tmp_t where t.a = tmp_t.aa
    ```

    If `t1` is limited to be `unique` and `not null` in the `aa` column. You can use the following statement, without aggregation.

    ```sql
    select * from t, t1 where t.a=t1.a
    ```

### tidb_opt_correlation_threshold

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 0.9
- This variable is used to set the threshold value that determines whether to enable estimating the row count by using column order correlation. If the order correlation between the current column and the `handle` column exceeds the threshold value, this method is enabled.

### tidb_opt_correlation_exp_factor

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 1
- When the method that estimates the number of rows based on column order correlation is not available, the heuristic estimation method is used. This variable is used to control the behavior of the heuristic method.
    - When the value is 0, the heuristic method is not used.
    - When the value is greater than 0:
        - A larger value indicates that an index scan will probably be used in the heuristic method.
        - A smaller value indicates that a table scan will probably be used in the heuristic method.

### tidb_enable_window_function

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 1, indicating enabling the window function feature.
- This variable is used to control whether to enable the support for window functions. Note that window functions may use reserved keywords. This might cause SQL statements that could be executed normally cannot be parsed after upgrading TiDB. In this case, you can set `tidb_enable_window_function` to `0`.

### tidb_slow_query_file

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: ""
- When `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SLOW_QUERY` is queried, only the slow query log name set by `slow-query-file` in the configuration file is parsed. The default slow query log name is "tidb-slow.log". To parse other logs, set the `tidb_slow_query_file` session variable to a specific file path, and then query `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SLOW_QUERY` to parse the slow query log based on the set file path. For details, see [Identify Slow Queries](/dev/how-to/maintain/identify-slow-queries.md).

### tidb_enable_fast_analyze

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 0, indicating not enabling the statistics fast `Analyze` feature.
- This variable is used to set whether to enable the statistics `Fast Analyze` feature.
- If the statistics `Fast Analyze` feature is enabled, TiDB randomly samples about 10,000 rows of data as statistics. When the data is distributed unevenly or the data size is small, the statistics accuracy is low. This might lead to a non-optimal execution plan, for example, selecting a wrong index. If the execution time of the regular `Analyze` statement is acceptable, it is recommended to disable the `Fast Analyze` feature.

### tidb_expensive_query_time_threshold

- Scope: SERVER
- Default value: 60
- This variable is used to set the threshold value that determines whether to print expensive query logs. The unit is second. The difference between expensive query logs and slow query logs is:
    - Slow logs are printed after the statement is executed.
    - Expensive query logs print the statements that are being executed, with execution time exceeding the threshold value, and their related information.

### tidb_wait_split_region_finish

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 1, indicating returning the result after all Regions are scattered.
- It usually takes a long time to scatter Regions, which is determined by PD scheduling and TiKV loads. This variable is used to set whether to return the result to the client after all Regions are scattered completely when the `SPLIT REGION` statement is being executed. Value `0` indicates returning the value before finishing scattering all Regions.
- Note that when scattering Regions, the write and read performances for the Region that is being scattered might be affected. In batch-write or data importing scenarios, it is recommended to import data after Regions scattering is finished.

### tidb_wait_split_region_timeout

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 300
- This variable is used to set the timeout for executing the `SPLIT REGION` statement. The unit is second. If a statement is not executed completely within the specified time value, a timeout error is returned.

### tidb_scatter_region

- Scope: GLOBAL
- Default value: 0
- By default, Regions are split for a new table when it is being created in TiDB. After this variable is enabled, the newly split Regions are scattered immediately during the execution of the `CREATE TABLE` statement. This applies to the scenario where data need to be written in batches right after the tables are created in batches, because the newly split Regions can be scattered in TiKV beforehand and do not have to wait to be scheduled by PD. To ensure the continuous stability of writing data in batches, the `CREATE TABLE` statement returns success only after the Regions are successfully scattered. This makes the statement's execution time multiple times longer than that when you disable this variable.

### tidb_allow_remove_auto_inc <span class="version-mark">New in v2.1.8 and v3.0.4</span>

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 0
- This variable is used to set whether the `auto_increment` property of a column is allowed to be removed by executing `ALTER TABLE MODIFY` or `ALTER TABLE CHANGE` statements. It is not allowed by default.
