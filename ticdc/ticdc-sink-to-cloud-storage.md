# Replicate Data to Storage Services

Starting from TiDB v6.5.0, TiCDC supports saving row change events to storage services, including Amazon S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage, and NFS. This document describes how to create a changefeed that replicates incremental data to such storage services using TiCDC, and how data is stored. The organization of this document is as follows:

- [How to replicate data to storage services](#replicate-change-data-to-storage-services).
- [How data is stored in storage services](#storage-path-structure).

## Replicate change data to storage services

Run the following command to create a changefeed task:

```shell
cdc cli changefeed create \
    --server=http://10.0.10.25:8300 \
    --sink-uri="s3://logbucket/storage_test?protocol=canal-json" \
    --changefeed-id="simple-replication-task"
```

The output is as follows:

```shell
Info: {"upstream_id":7171388873935111376,"namespace":"default","id":"simple-replication-task","sink_uri":"s3://logbucket/storage_test?protocol=canal-json","create_time":"2022-11-29T18:52:05.566016967+08:00","start_ts":437706850431664129,"engine":"unified","config":{"case_sensitive":true,"enable_old_value":true,"force_replicate":false,"ignore_ineligible_table":false,"check_gc_safe_point":true,"enable_sync_point":false,"sync_point_interval":600000000000,"sync_point_retention":86400000000000,"filter":{"rules":["*.*"],"event_filters":null},"mounter":{"worker_num":16},"sink":{"protocol":"canal-json","schema_registry":"","csv":{"delimiter":",","quote":"\"","null":"\\N","include_commit_ts":false},"column_selectors":null,"transaction_atomicity":"none","encoder_concurrency":16,"terminator":"\r\n","date_separator":"none","enable_partition_separator":false},"consistent":{"level":"none","max_log_size":64,"flush_interval":2000,"storage":""}},"state":"normal","creator_version":"v6.5.0-master-dirty"}
```

- `--changefeed-id`: The ID of the changefeed. The format must match the `^[a-zA-Z0-9]+(\-[a-zA-Z0-9]+)*$` regular expression. If this ID is not specified, TiCDC automatically generates a UUID (the version 4 format) as the ID.
- `--sink-uri`: The downstream address of the changefeed. For details, see [Configure sink URI](#configure-sink-uri).
- `--start-ts`: The starting TSO of the changefeed. TiCDC starts pulling data from this TSO. The default value is the current time.
- `--target-ts`: The ending TSO of the changefeed. TiCDC stops pulling data until this TSO. The default value is empty, which means that TiCDC does not automatically stop pulling data.
- `--config`: The configuration file of the changefeed. For details, see [TiCDC changefeed configuration parameters](/ticdc/ticdc-changefeed-config.md).

## Configure sink URI

This section describes how to configure Sink URI for storage services, including Amazon S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage, and NFS. Sink URI is used to specify the connection information of the TiCDC target system. The format is as follows:

```shell
[scheme]://[host]/[path]?[query_parameters]
```

For `[query_parameters]` in the URI, the following parameters can be configured:

| Parameter | Description | Default value | Value range |
| :---------| :---------- | :------------ | :---------- |
| `worker-count` | Concurrency for saving data changes to cloud storage in the downstream.  | `16` | `[1, 512]` |
| `flush-interval` | Interval for saving data changes to cloud storage in the downstream.   | `5s` | `[2s, 10m]` |
| `file-size` | A data change file is stored to cloud storage if the number of bytes exceeds the value of this parameter. | `67108864` | `[1048576, 536870912]` |
| `protocol` | The protocol format of the messages sent to the downstream.  | N/A |  `canal-json` and `csv` |
| `enable-tidb-extension` | When `protocol` is set to `canal-json` and `enable-tidb-extension` is set to `true`, TiCDC sends [WATERMARK events](/ticdc/ticdc-canal-json.md#watermark-event) and adds the [TiDB extension field](/ticdc/ticdc-canal-json.md#tidb-extension-field) to Canal-JSON messages. | `false` | `false` and `true` |

> **Note:**
>
> Data change files are saved to the downstream when either `flush-interval` or `file-size` meets the requirements.
> The `protocol` parameter is mandatory. If TiCDC does not receive this parameter when creating a changefeed, the `CDC:ErrSinkUnknownProtocol` error is returned.

### Configure sink URI for external storage

The following is an example configuration for Amazon S3:

```shell
--sink-uri="s3://bucket/prefix?protocol=canal-json"
```

The following is an example configuration for GCS:

```shell
--sink-uri="gcs://bucket/prefix?protocol=canal-json"
```

The following is an example configuration for Azure Blob Storage:

```shell
--sink-uri="azure://bucket/prefix?protocol=canal-json"
```

> **Tip:**
>
> The URI parameters of Amazon S3, GCS, and Azure Blob Storage in TiCDC are the same as their URI parameters in BR. For details, see [Backup storage URI format](/br/backup-and-restore-storages.md#uri-format-description).

### Configure sink URI for NFS

The following is an example configuration for NFS:

```shell
--sink-uri="file:///my-directory/prefix?protocol=canal-json"
```

## Storage path structure

This section describes the storage path structure of data change records, metadata, and DDL events.

### Data change records

Data change records are saved to the following path:

```shell
{scheme}://{prefix}/{schema}/{table}/{table-version-separator}/{partition-separator}/{date-separator}/CDC{num}.{extension}
```

- `scheme`: specifies the storage type, for example, `s3`, `gcs`, `azure`, or `file`.
- `prefix`: specifies the user-defined parent directory, for example, <code>s3://**bucket/bbb/ccc**</code>.
- `schema`: specifies the schema name, for example, <code>s3://bucket/bbb/ccc/**test**</code>.
- `table`: specifies the table name, for example, <code>s3://bucket/bbb/ccc/test/**table1**</code>.
- `table-version-separator`: specifies the separator that separates the path by the table version, for example, <code>s3://bucket/bbb/ccc/test/table1/**9999**</code>.
- `partition-separator`: specifies the separator that separates the path by the table partition, for example, <code>s3://bucket/bbb/ccc/test/table1/9999/**20**</code>.
- `date-separator`: classifies the files by the transaction commit date. Value options are:
    - `none`: no `date-separator`. For example, all files with `test.table1` version being `9999` are saved to `s3://bucket/bbb/ccc/test/table1/9999`.
    - `year`: the separator is the year of the transaction commit date, for example, <code>s3://bucket/bbb/ccc/test/table1/9999/**2022**</code>.
    - `month`: the separator is the year and month of the transaction commit date, for example, <code>s3://bucket/bbb/ccc/test/table1/9999/**2022-01**</code>.
    - `day`: the separator is the year, month, and day of the transaction commit date, for example, <code>s3://bucket/bbb/ccc/test/table1/9999/**2022-01-02**</code>.
- `num`: saves the serial number of the file that records the data change, for example, <code>s3://bucket/bbb/ccc/test/table1/9999/2022-01-02/CDC**000005**.csv</code>.
- `extension`: specifies the extension of the file. TiDB v6.5.0 supports the CSV and Canal-JSON formats.

> **Note:**
>
> The table version changes in the following three cases:
>
> - After a DDL operation is performed, the table version is the TSO when the DDL is executed in the upstream TiDB. However, the change of the table version does not mean the change of the table schema. For example, adding a comment to a column does not cause the `schema.json` file content to change.
> - The changefeed process restarts. The table version is the checkpoint TSO when the process restarts. When there are many tables and the process restarts, it takes a long time to traverse all directories and find the position where each table was written last time. Therefore, data is written to a new directory with the version being the checkpoint TSO, instead of to the earlier directory.
> - After a table scheduling occurs, the table version is the Changefeed checkpoint TSO when the table is scheduled to the current node.

### Index files

An index file is used to prevent written data from being overwritten by mistake. It is stored in the same path as the data change records.

```shell
{scheme}://{prefix}/{schema}/{table}/{table-version-separator}/{partition-separator}/{date-separator}/CDC.index
```

The index file records the largest file name used in the current directory. For example:

```
CDC000005.csv
```

In this example, the files `CDC000001.csv` through `CDC000004.csv` in this directory are occupied. When a table scheduling or node restart occurs in the TiCDC cluster, the new node reads the index file and determines if `CDC000005.csv` is occupied. If it is not occupied, the new node writes the file starting from `CDC000005.csv`. If it is occupied, it starts writing from `CDC000006.csv`, which prevents overwriting data written by other nodes.

### Metadata

Metadata is saved in the following path:

```shell
{protocol}://{prefix}/metadata
```

Metadata is a JSON-formatted file, for example:

```json
{
    "checkpoint-ts":433305438660591626
}
```

- `checkpoint-ts`: Transactions with `commit-ts` smaller than `checkpoint-ts` are written to the target storage in the downstream.

### DDL events

When DDL events cause the table version to change, TiCDC switches to a new path to write data change records. For example, when the version of `test.table1` changes from `9999` to `10000`, data will be written to the path `s3://bucket/bbb/ccc/test/table1/10000/2022-01-02/CDC000001.csv`. In addition, when DDL events occur, TiCDC generates a `schema.json` file to save the table schema information.

Table schema information is saved in the following path:

```shell
{scheme}://{prefix}/{schema}/{table}/{table-version-separator}/schema.json
```

The following is a `schema.json` file:

```json
{
    "Table":"table1",
    "Schema":"test",
    "Version":1,
    "TableVersion":10000,
    "Query": "ALTER TABLE test.table1 ADD OfficeLocation blob(20)",
    "TableColumns":[
        {
            "ColumnName":"Id",
            "ColumnType":"INT",
            "ColumnNullable":"false",
            "ColumnIsPk":"true"
        },
        {
            "ColumnName":"LastName",
            "ColumnType":"CHAR",
            "ColumnLength":"20"
        },
        {
            "ColumnName":"FirstName",
            "ColumnType":"VARCHAR",
            "ColumnLength":"30"
        },
        {

            "ColumnType":"DATETIME"
        },
        {
            "ColumnName":"OfficeLocation",
            "ColumnType":"BLOB",
            "ColumnLength":"20"
        }
    ],
    "TableColumnsTotal":"5"
