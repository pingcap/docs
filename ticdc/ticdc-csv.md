# TiCDC CSV Protocol

When using a cloud storage service as the downstream sink, you can send DML events to the cloud storage service in CSV format.

## Use CSV

The following is an example of the configuration when using the CSV protocol:

```shell
cdc cli changefeed create --server=http://127.0.0.1:8300 --changefeed-id="csv-test" --sink-uri="s3://bucket/prefix" --config changefeed.toml
```

The configuration in the `changefeed.toml` file is as follows:

```toml
[sink]
protocol = "csv"
terminator = "\n"

[sink.csv]
delimiter = ',' # Before v7.6.0, you can only set the delimiter to a single character. Starting from v7.6.0, you can set it to 1-3 characters. For example, `$^` or `|@|`.
quote = '"'
null = '\N'
include-commit-ts = true
output-old-value = false
```

## Transactional constraints

- In a single CSV file, the `commit-ts` of a row is equal to or smaller than that of the subsequent row.
- The same transactions of a single table are stored in the same CSV file.
- Multiple tables of the same transaction can be stored in different CSV files.

## Data storage path structure

For more information about the storage path structure of the data, see [Storage path structure](/ticdc/ticdc-sink-to-cloud-storage.md#storage-path-structure).

## Definition of the data format

In the CSV file, each column is defined as follows:

- Column 1: The operation-type indicator, including `I`, `U`, and `D`. `I` means `INSERT`, `U` means `UPDATE`, and `D` means `DELETE`.
- Column 2: Table name.
- Column 3: Schema name.
- Column 4: The `commit-ts` of the source transaction. This column is optional.
- Column 5: The `is-update` column only exists when the value of `output-old-value` is true, which is used to identify whether the row data change comes from the UPDATE event (the value of the column is true) or the INSERT/DELETE event (the value is false).
- Column 6 to the last column: One or more columns with data changes.

Assume that table `hr.employee` is defined as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `employee` (
  `Id` int NOT NULL,
  `LastName` varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL,
  `FirstName` varchar(30) DEFAULT NULL,
  `HireDate` date DEFAULT NULL,
  `OfficeLocation` varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
```

When `include-commit-ts = true` and `output-old-value = false`, the DML events of this table are stored in the CSV format as follows:

```shell
"I","employee","hr",433305438660591626,101,"Smith","Bob","2014-06-04","New York"
"U","employee","hr",433305438660591627,101,"Smith","Bob","2015-10-08","Los Angeles"
"D","employee","hr",433305438660591629,101,"Smith","Bob","2017-03-13","Dallas"
"I","employee","hr",433305438660591630,102,"Alex","Alice","2017-03-14","Shanghai"
"U","employee","hr",433305438660591630,102,"Alex","Alice","2018-06-15","Beijing"
```

When `include-commit-ts = true` and `output-old-value = true`, the DML events of this table are stored in the CSV format as follows:

```
"I","employee","hr",433305438660591626,false,101,"Smith","Bob","2014-06-04","New York"
"D","employee","hr",433305438660591627,true,101,"Smith","Bob","2015-10-08","Shanghai"
"I","employee","hr",433305438660591627,true,101,"Smith","Bob","2015-10-08","Los Angeles"
"D","employee","hr",433305438660591629,false,101,"Smith","Bob","2017-03-13","Dallas"
"I","employee","hr",433305438660591630,false,102,"Alex","Alice","2017-03-14","Shanghai"
"D","employee","hr",433305438660591630,true,102,"Alex","Alice","2017-03-14","Beijing"
"I","employee","hr",433305438660591630,true,102,"Alex","Alice","2018-06-15","Beijing"
```
