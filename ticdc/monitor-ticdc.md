# TiCDC Monitoring Metrics Details

You can get an overview of TiCDC's current status from the TiCDC dashboard, where the key metrics are displayed. This document provides a detailed description of these key metrics.

The metric description in this document is based on the following replication task example, which replicates data to MySQL using the default configuration.

```shell
cdc cli changefeed create --server=http://10.0.10.25:8300 --sink-uri="mysql://root:123456@127.0.0.1:3306/" --changefeed-id="simple-replication-task"
```

## Metrics for TiCDC in the new architecture

The monitoring dashboard **TiCDC-New-Arch** for [TiCDC New Architecture](/ticdc/ticdc-architecture.md) is not managed by TiUP yet. To view the related monitoring data on Grafana, you need to manually import the TiCDC monitoring metrics file:

1. Download the monitoring metrics file for TiCDC in the new architecture:

    ```shell
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pingcap/ticdc/refs/heads/release-8.5/metrics/grafana/ticdc_new_arch.json
    ```

2. Import the downloaded metrics file on Grafana:
