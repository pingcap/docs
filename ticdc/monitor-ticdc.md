# Key Monitoring Metrics of TiCDC

If you use TiUP to deploy the TiDB cluster, you can see a sub-dashboard for TiCDC in the monitoring system which is deployed at the same time. You can get an overview of TiCDC's current status from the TiCDC dashboard, where the key metrics are displayed. This document provides a detailed description of these key metrics.

The metric description in this document is based on the following replication task example, which replicates data to MySQL using the default configuration.

```shell
cdc cli changefeed create --pd=http://10.0.10.25:2379 --sink-uri="mysql://root:123456@127.0.0.1:3306/" --changefeed-id="simple-replication-task"
```

The TiCDC dashboard contains four monitoring panels. See the following screenshot:

The description of each panel is as follows:

- [**Server**](#server): The summary information of TiKV nodes and TiCDC nodes in the TiDB cluster
- [**Changefeed**](#changefeed): The detailed information of TiCDC replication tasks
- [**Events**](#events): The detail information about the data flow within the TiCDC cluster
- [**TiKV**](#tikv): TiKV information related to TiCDC

## Server

The following is an example of the **Server** panel:

The description of each metric in the **Server** panel is as follows:

- Uptime: The time for which TiKV nodes and TiCDC nodes have been running

- Ownership history: The ownership history of the TiCDC cluster
- CPU usage: The CPU usage of TiCDC nodes
- Memory usage: The memory usage of TiCDC nodes

## Changefeed

The following is an example of the **Changefeed** panel:
