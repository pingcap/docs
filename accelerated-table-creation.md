# TiDB Accelerated Table Creation

TiDB v7.6.0 introduces the system variable [`tidb_ddl_version`](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.6/system-variables#tidb_enable_fast_create_table-new-in-v800) to support accelerating table creation, which improves the efficiency of bulk table creation. Starting from v8.0.0, this system variable is renamed to [`tidb_enable_fast_create_table`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_fast_create_table-new-in-v800).

When accelerated table creation is enabled via [`tidb_enable_fast_create_table`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_fast_create_table-new-in-v800), table creation statements with the same schema committed to the same TiDB node at the same time are merged into batch table creation statements to improve table creation performance. Therefore, to improve the table creation performance, try to connect to the same TiDB node, create tables with the same schema concurrently, and increase the concurrency appropriately.

The merged batch table creation statements are executed within the same transaction, so if one statement of them fails, all of them will fail.

## Compatibility with TiDB tools

- Before TiDB v8.3.0, [TiCDC](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/ticdc-overview) does not support replicating the tables that are created by `tidb_enable_fast_create_table`. Starting from v8.3.0, TiCDC can properly replicate these tables.

## Limitation

You can now use performance optimization for table creation only in the [`CREATE TABLE`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-create-table.md) statement, and this statement must not include any foreign key constraints.

## Use `tidb_enable_fast_create_table` to accelerate table creation

You can enable or disable performance optimization for creating tables by specifying the value of the system variable [`tidb_enable_fast_create_table`](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_fast_create_table-new-in-v800).

Starting from TiDB v8.5.0, the accelerated table creation feature is enabled by default for newly created clusters, with `tidb_enable_fast_create_table` set to `ON`. For clusters upgraded from v8.4.0 or earlier versions, the default value of `tidb_enable_fast_create_table` remains unchanged.

To enable performance optimization for creating tables, set the value of this variable to `ON`:

```sql
SET GLOBAL tidb_enable_fast_create_table = ON;
```

To disable performance optimization for creating tables, set the value of this variable to `OFF`:

```sql
SET GLOBAL tidb_enable_fast_create_table = OFF;
```
