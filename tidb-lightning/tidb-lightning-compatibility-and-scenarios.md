# Compatibility of TiDB Lightning and IMPORT INTO with TiCDC and Log Backup

This document describes TiDB Lightning and [`IMPORT INTO`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-import-into.md) compatibility with [log backup](/br/br-pitr-guide.md) and [TiCDC](/ticdc/ticdc-overview.md), as well as some special usage scenarios.

## `IMPORT INTO` vs. TiDB Lightning

[`IMPORT INTO`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-import-into.md) integrates with the physical import mode of TiDB Lightning, but there are some differences. See [`IMPORT INTO` vs. TiDB Lightning](/tidb-lightning/import-into-vs-tidb-lightning.md) for details.

## Compatibility with log backup and TiCDC

- TiDB Lightning [logical import mode](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-logical-import-mode.md) is compatible with log backup and TiCDC.

- TiDB Lightning [physical import mode](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode.md) is not compatible with log backup and TiCDC. The reason is that physical import mode directly ingests encoded KV pairs of the source data to TiKV, causing TiKV not to generate corresponding change logs during this process. Without such change logs, the relevant data cannot be backed up via log backup and cannot be replicated by TiCDC.

- To use TiDB Lightning and TiCDC together in a cluster, see [Compatibility with TiDB Lightning](/ticdc/ticdc-compatibility.md#compatibility-with-tidb-lightning).

- `IMPORT INTO` is not compatible with log backup and TiCDC. The reason is that `IMPORT INTO` also ingests encoded KV pairs of the source data directly to TiKV.

## Scenarios for TiDB Lightning logical import mode

If TiDB Lightning logical import mode can meet your application's performance requirements and your application requires imported tables to be backed up or replicated downstream using TiCDC, it is recommended to use TiDB Lightning logical import mode.

## Scenarios for TiDB Lightning physical import mode

This section describes how to use TiDB Lightning together with [log backup](/br/br-pitr-guide.md) and [TiCDC](/ticdc/ticdc-overview.md).

If TiDB Lightning logical import mode does not meet your application's performance requirements, you have to use TiDB Lightning physical import mode, and imported tables need to be backed up or replicated downstream using TiCDC, then the following scenarios are recommended.

### Used with log backup

In this scenario, if [PITR](/br/br-log-architecture.md#process-of-pitr) is enabled, the compatibility check will report an error after TiDB Lightning starts. If you are sure that these tables do not need backup, you can change the `Lightning.check-requirements` parameter in the [TiDB Lightning configuration file](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task) to `false` and restart the import task.

Data imported using TiDB Lightning physical import mode cannot be backed up via log backup. If you need to back up the table, it is recommended to perform a table-level snapshot backup after the import, as described in [Back up a table](/br/br-snapshot-manual.md#back-up-a-table). 

### Used with TiCDC

Using TiCDC with physical import mode is not compatible in the short term, because TiCDC cannot keep up with the write speed of TiDB Lightning physical import mode, which might result in increasing cluster replication latency.

You can perform in different scenarios as follows:

- Scenario 1: the table does not need to be replicated downstream by TiCDC.

    In this scenario, if TiCDC changefeed is enabled, the compatibility check will report an error after TiDB Lightning starts. If you are sure that these tables do not need backup or [log backup](/br/br-pitr-guide.md), you can change the `Lightning.check-requirements` parameter in the [TiDB Lightning configuration file](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task) to `false` and restart the import task.

- Scenario 2: the table needs to be replicated downstream by TiCDC.

    In this scenario, if TiCDC changefeed is enabled, the compatibility check will report an error after TiDB Lightning starts. You need to change the `Lightning.check-requirements` parameter in the [TiDB Lightning configuration file](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task) in the upstream TiDB cluster to `false` and restart the import task.

    After the import task for the upstream TiDB cluster is finished, use TiDB Lightning to import the same data in the downstream TiDB cluster. If you have databases such as Redshift and Snowflake in the downstream, you can configure them to read CSV, SQL, or Parquet files from a cloud storage service and then write the data to the database.

## Scenarios for `IMPORT INTO`

This section describes how to use `IMPORT INTO` together with [log backup](/br/br-pitr-guide.md) and [TiCDC](/ticdc/ticdc-overview.md).

### Used with log backup

In this scenario, if [PITR](/br/br-log-architecture.md#process-of-pitr) is enabled, the compatibility check will report an error after you submit the `IMPORT INTO` statement. If you are sure that these tables do not need backup, you can include `DISABLE_PRECHECK` (introduced in v8.0.0) in [`WithOptions`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-import-into.md#withoptions) of that statement, and then resubmit it. In this way, the data import task ignores the compatibility check and imports the data directly.

Data imported using `IMPORT INTO` cannot be backed up via log backup. If you need to back up the table, it is recommended to perform a table-level snapshot backup after the import, as described in [Back up a table](/br/br-snapshot-manual.md#back-up-a-table).

### Used with TiCDC

You can perform in different scenarios as follows:

- Scenario 1: the table does not need to be replicated downstream by TiCDC.

    In this scenario, if TiCDC changefeed is enabled, the compatibility check will report an error after you submit the `IMPORT INTO` statement. If you are sure that these tables do not need to be replicated by TiCDC, you can include `DISABLE_PRECHECK` (introduced in v8.0.0) in [`WithOptions`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-import-into.md#withoptions) of that statement, and then resubmit it. In this way, the data import task ignores the compatibility check and imports the data directly.

- Scenario 2: the table needs to be replicated downstream by TiCDC.

    In this scenario, if TiCDC changefeed is enabled, the compatibility check will report an error after you submit the `IMPORT INTO` statement. You can include `DISABLE_PRECHECK` (introduced in v8.0.0) in [`WithOptions`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-import-into.md#withoptions) of that statement, and then resubmit it. In this way, the data import task ignores the compatibility check and imports the data directly.

    After the import task for the upstream TiDB cluster is finished, use `IMPORT INTO` to import the same data in the downstream TiDB cluster. If you have databases such as Redshift and Snowflake in the downstream, you can configure them to read CSV, SQL, or Parquet files from a cloud storage service and then write the data to the database.
