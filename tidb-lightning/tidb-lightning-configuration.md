# TiDB Lightning Configuration

This document provides samples for global configuration, task configuration, and TiKV Importer configuration in TiDB Lightning, and describes the usage of command-line parameters.

## Configuration files

TiDB Lightning has two configuration classes: "global" and "task", and they have compatible structures. Their distinction arises only when the [server mode](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-web-interface.md) is enabled. When server mode is disabled (the default), TiDB Lightning will only execute one task, and the same configuration file is used for both global and task configurations.

### TiDB Lightning (Global)

```toml
### tidb-lightning global configuration

[lightning]
# The HTTP port for displaying the web interface, pulling Prometheus metrics, exposing debug data, and submitting import tasks (in server mode). Setting it to 0 disables the port.
status-addr = ':8289'

# Server mode. Defaults to false, which means an import task starts immediately after you execute the command.
# If this value is set to true, after you execute the command, TiDB Lightning waits until you submit an import task in the web interface.
# See the "TiDB Lightning Web Interface" section for details.
server-mode = false

# Logging
level = "info"
file = "tidb-lightning.log"
max-size = 128 # MB
max-days = 28
max-backups = 14
```

### TiDB Lightning (Task)

```toml
### tidb-lightning task configuration

[lightning]
# Checks whether the cluster satisfies the minimum requirement before starting.
#check-requirements = true

# The maximum number of engines to be opened concurrently.
# Each table is split into one "index engine" to store indices, and multiple
# "data engines" to store row data. These settings control the maximum
# concurrent number for each type of engines.
# These values affect the memory and disk usage of tikv-importer.
# The sum of these two values must not exceed the max-open-engines setting
# for tikv-importer.
index-concurrency = 2
table-concurrency = 6

# The concurrency number of data. It is set to the number of logical CPU
# cores by default. When deploying together with other components, you can
# set it to 75% of the size of logical CPU cores to limit the CPU usage.
#region-concurrency =

# The maximum I/O concurrency. Excessive I/O concurrency causes an increase in
# I/O latency because the disk's internal buffer is frequently refreshed,
# which causes the cache miss and slows down the read speed. Depending on the storage
# medium, this value might need to be adjusted for optimal performance.
io-concurrency = 5

# The maximum number of non-fatal errors to tolerate before stopping TiDB Lightning.
# Non-fatal errors are localized to a few rows, and ignoring those rows allows the import process to continue.
# Setting this to N means that TiDB Lightning will stop as soon as possible when the (N+1)-th error is encountered.
# The skipped rows will be inserted into tables inside the "task info" schema on the target TiDB, which can be configured below.
max-error = 0
# task-info-schema-name is the name of the schema or database that stores TiDB Lightning execution results.
# To disable error recording, set this to an empty string.
# task-info-schema-name = 'lightning_task_info'

# In parallel import mode, the schema name that stores the meta information for each TiDB Lightning instance in the target cluster. By default, the value is "lightning_metadata".
# Configure this parameter only if parallel import is enabled.
# **Note:**
# - The value set for this parameter must be the same for each TiDB Lightning instance that participates in the same parallel import; otherwise, the correctness of the imported data cannot be ensured.
# - If parallel import mode is enabled, make sure that the user used for import (for the tidb.user configuration) has permissions to create and access the databases corresponding to this configuration.
# - TiDB Lightning removes this schema after the import is completed. So do not use any existing schema name to configure this parameter.
meta-schema-name = "lightning_metadata"

[security]
# Specifies certificates and keys for TLS connections within the cluster.
# Public certificate of the CA. Leave empty to disable TLS.
# ca-path = "/path/to/ca.pem"
# Public certificate of this service.
# cert-path = "/path/to/lightning.pem"
# Private key of this service.
# key-path = "/path/to/lightning.key"

[checkpoint]
# Whether to enable checkpoints.
# While importing data, TiDB Lightning records which tables have been imported, so
# even if TiDB Lightning or another component crashes, you can start from a known
# good state instead of restarting from scratch.
enable = true
# The schema name (database name) to store the checkpoints.
schema = "tidb_lightning_checkpoint"
# Where to store the checkpoints.
#  - file:  store as a local file.
#  - mysql: store into a remote MySQL-compatible database
driver = "file"
# The data source name (DSN) indicating the location of the checkpoint storage.
# For the "file" driver, the DSN is a path. If the path is not specified, TiDB Lightning would
# default to "/tmp/CHECKPOINT_SCHEMA.pb".
# For the "mysql" driver, the DSN is a URL in the form of "USER:PASS@tcp(HOST:PORT)/".
# If the URL is not specified, the TiDB server from the [tidb] section is used to
# store the checkpoints. You should specify a different MySQL-compatible
# database server to reduce the load of the target TiDB cluster.
# dsn = "/tmp/tidb_lightning_checkpoint.pb"
# Whether to keep the checkpoints after all data are imported. If false, the
# checkpoints will be deleted. Keeping the checkpoints can aid debugging but
# will leak metadata about the data source.
# keep-after-success = false

[tikv-importer]
# "local": The default mode. It applies to large dataset import, for example, greater than 1 TiB. However, during the import, downstream TiDB is not available to provide services.
# "tidb": You can use this mode for small dataset import, for example, smaller than 1 TiB. During the import, downstream TiDB is available to provide services.
# backend = "local"
# Whether to allow importing data to tables with data. The default value is `false`.
# When you use parallel import mode, you must set it to `true`, because multiple TiDB Lightning instances are importing the same table at the same time.
# incremental-import = false

# The listening address of tikv-importer when backend is "importer". Change it to the actual address.
addr = "172.16.31.10:8287"
# Action to do when trying to insert a duplicated entry in the "tidb" backend.
#  - replace: use new entry to replace the existing entry
#  - ignore: keep the existing entry, and ignore the new entry
#  - error: report error and quit the program
# on-duplicate = "replace"
# Whether to detect and resolve duplicate records (unique key conflict) when the backend is 'local'.
# The following resolution algorithms are supported:
#  - record: only records duplicate records to the `lightning_task_info.conflict_error_v1` table on the target TiDB. Note that the
#    required version of the target TiKV is no earlier than v5.2.0; otherwise it falls back to 'none'.
#  - none: does not detect duplicate records, which has the best performance of the three algorithms, but might lead to
#    inconsistent data in the target TiDB.
#  - remove: records all duplicate records to the lightning_task_info database, like the 'record' algorithm. But it removes all duplicate records from the target table to ensure a consistent
#    state in the target TiDB.
# duplicate-resolution = 'none'
# The number of KV pairs sent in one request in the "local" backend.
# send-kv-pairs = 32768
# The directory of local KV sorting in the "local" backend. If the disk
# performance is low (such as in HDD), it is recommended to set the directory
# on a different disk from `data-source-dir` to improve import speed.
# sorted-kv-dir = ""
# The concurrency that TiKV writes KV data in the "local" backend.
# When the network transmission speed between TiDB Lightning and TiKV
# exceeds 10 Gigabit, you can increase this value accordingly.
# range-concurrency = 16

[mydumper]
# Block size for file reading. Keep it longer than the longest string of the data source.
read-block-size = "64KiB" # default value

# The engine file needs to be imported sequentially. Due to parallel processing,
# multiple data engines will be imported at nearly the same time, and this
# creates a queue and wastes resources. Therefore, TiDB Lightning slightly
# increases the size of the first few batches to properly distribute
# resources. The scale up factor is controlled by this parameter, which
# expresses the ratio of duration between the "import" and "write" steps
# with full concurrency. This can be calculated by using the ratio
# (import duration/write duration) of a single table of size around 1 GiB.
# The exact timing can be found in the log. If "import" is faster, the batch
# size variance is smaller, and a ratio of zero means a uniform batch size.
# This value should be in the range (0 <= batch-import-ratio < 1).
batch-import-ratio = 0.75

# Local source data directory or the URL of the external storage.
data-source-dir = "/data/my_database"

# The character set of the schema files, containing CREATE TABLE statements;
# only supports one of:
#  - utf8mb4: the schema files must be encoded as UTF-8; otherwise, an error is reported.
#  - gb18030: the schema files must be encoded as GB-18030; otherwise,
#             an error is reported
#  - auto:    (default) automatically detects whether the schema is UTF-8 or
#             GB-18030. An error is reported if the encoding is neither.
#  - binary:  do not try to decode the schema files
character-set = "auto"

# Specifies the character set of the source data file. Lightning converts the source file from the specified character set to UTF-8 encoding when importing.
# Currently, this configuration only specifies the character set of the CSV files with the following options supported:
# - utf8mb4: Indicates that the source data file uses UTF-8 encoding.
# - GB18030: Indicates that the source data file uses the GB-18030 encoding.
# - GBK: The source data file uses GBK encoding (GBK encoding is an extension of the GB-2312 character set, also known as Code Page 936).
# - binary: Indicates that Lightning does not convert the encoding (by default).
# If left blank, the default value "binary" is used, that is to say, Lightning does not convert the encoding.
# Note that Lightning does not predict about the character set of the source data file and only converts the source file and import the data based on this configuration.
# If the value of this configuration is not the same as the actual encoding of the source data file, a failed import, data loss or data disorder might appear.
data-character-set = "binary"
# Specifies the replacement character in case of incompatible characters during the character set conversion of the source data file.
# This configuration must not be duplicated with field separators, quote definers, and line breaks.
# The default value is "\uFFFD", which is the "error" Rune or Unicode replacement character in UTF-8 encoding.
# Changing the default value might result in potential degradation of parsing performance for the source data file.
data-invalid-char-replace = "\uFFFD"

# the input data in a "strict" format speeds up processing.
# "strict-format = true" requires that:
# in CSV, every value cannot contain literal new lines (U+000A and U+000D, or \r and \n) even
# when quoted, which means new lines are strictly used to separate rows.
# "Strict" format allows TiDB Lightning to quickly locate split positions of a large file for parallel processing.
# However, if the input data is not "strict", it may split a valid data in half and
# corrupt the result.
# The default value is false for safety instead of speed.
strict-format = false

# If strict-format is true, TiDB Lightning splits large CSV files into multiple chunks to process in
# parallel. max-region-size is the maximum size of each chunk after splitting.
# max-region-size = "256MiB" # default value

# Only import tables if these wildcard rules are matched. See the corresponding section for details.
