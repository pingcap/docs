# TiDB Lightning Backends

The backend determines how TiDB Lightning imports data into the target cluster.

TiDB Lightning supports the following [backends](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-glossary.md#back-end):

+ [Importer-backend](#tidb-lightning-importer-backend) (default)
+ [Local-backend](#tidb-lightning-local-backend)
+ [TiDB-backend](#tidb-lightning-tidb-backend)

The **Importer-backend** (default): `tidb-lightning` first encodes the SQL or CSV data into KV pairs, and relies on the external `tikv-importer` program to sort these KV pairs and ingest directly into the TiKV nodes.

The **Local-backend**: `tidb-lightning` first encodes data into key-value pairs, sorts and stores them in a local temporary directory, and *upload* these key-value pairs to each TiKV node *as SST files*. Then, TiKV ingests these *SST files* into the cluster. The implementation of Local-backend is the same with that of Importer-backend but does not rely on the external `tikv-importer` component.

The **TiDB-backend**: `tidb-lightning` first encodes these data into SQL `INSERT` statements, and has these statements executed directly on the TiDB node.

| Backend | Local-backend | Importer-backend | TiDB-backend |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Speed | Fast (~500 GB/hr) | Fast (~300 GB/hr) | Slow (~50 GB/hr) |
| Resource usage | High | High | Low |
| Network bandwidth usage| High | Medium | Low |
| ACID respected while importing | No | No | Yes |
| Target tables | Must be empty | Must be empty | Can be populated |
| Additional component required | No | `tikv-importer` | No |
| TiDB versions supported | >= v4.0.0 | All | All |
| TiDB services impacted | Yes | Yes | No |

## How to choose the backend modes

- If the target cluster of data import is v4.0 or later versions, consider using the Local-backend mode first, which is easier to use and has higher performance than that of the other two modes.
- If the target cluster of data import is v3.x or earlier versions, it is recommended to use the Importer-backend mode.
- If the target cluster of data import is in the online production environment, or if the target table of data import already has data on it, it is recommended to use the TiDB-backend mode.

## TiDB Lightning Local-backend

The Local-backend feature is introduced to TiDB Lightning since TiDB v4.0.3. You can use this feature to import data to TiDB clusters of v4.0.0 or above.

### Deployment for Local-backend

To deploy TiDB Lightning in the Local-backend mode, see [TiDB Lightning Deployment](/tidb-lightning/deploy-tidb-lightning.md).

## TiDB Lightning TiDB-backend

> **Note:**
>
> Since TiDB v4.0, PingCAP no longer maintains the [Loader](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v4.0/loader-overview) tool. Since v5.0, the Loader documentation is no longer available. Loader's functionality has been completely replaced by the TiDB-backend of TiDB Lightning, so it is highly recommended to switch to TiDB Lightning.

### Deployment for TiDB-backend

When using the TiDB-backend, deploying `tikv-importer` is not necessary. Compared with the [standard deployment procedure](/tidb-lightning/deploy-tidb-lightning.md), the TiDB-backend deployment has the following two differences:

* All steps involving `tikv-importer` can be skipped.
* The configuration must be changed to declare that the TiDB-backend is used.

#### Hardware requirements

The speed of TiDB Lightning using TiDB-backend is limited by the SQL processing speed of TiDB. Therefore, even a lower-end machine may max out the possible performance. The recommended hardware configuration is:

* 16 logical cores CPU
* An SSD large enough to store the entire data source, preferring higher read speed
* 1 Gigabit network card

#### Manual deployment

You do not need to download and configure `tikv-importer`. You can download TiDB Lightning from [here](/download-ecosystem-tools.md#tidb-lightning).

Before running `tidb-lightning`, add the following lines into the configuration file:

```toml
[tikv-importer]
backend = "tidb"
```

or supplying the `--backend tidb` arguments when executing `tidb-lightning`.

### Conflict resolution

The TiDB-backend supports importing to an already-populated table. However, the new data might cause a unique key conflict with the old data. You can control how to resolve the conflict by using this task configuration.

```toml
[tikv-importer]
backend = "tidb"
on-duplicate = "replace" # or "error" or "ignore"
```

| Setting | Behavior on conflict | Equivalent SQL statement |
|:---|:---|:---|
| replace | New entries replace old ones | `REPLACE INTO ...` |
| ignore | Keep old entries and ignore new ones | `INSERT IGNORE INTO ...` |
| error | Abort import | `INSERT INTO ...` |

### Migrating from Loader to TiDB Lightning TiDB-backend

If you need to import data into a TiDB cluster, TiDB Lightning using the TiDB-backend can completely replace the functionalities of [Loader](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v4.0/loader-overview). The following list shows how to translate Loader configurations into [TiDB Lightning configurations](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md).

## TiDB Lightning Importer-backend

### Deployment for Importer-backend mode

This section describes how to [deploy TiDB Lightning manually](#deploy-tidb-lightning-manually) in the Importer-backend mode:

#### Hardware requirements

`tidb-lightning` and `tikv-importer` are both resource-intensive programs. It is recommended to deploy them into two separate machines.

To achieve the best performance, it is recommended to use the following hardware configuration:

- `tidb-lightning`:

    - 32+ logical cores CPU
    - An SSD large enough to store the entire data source, preferring higher read speed
    - 10 Gigabit network card (capable of transferring at ≥300 MB/s)
    - `tidb-lightning` fully consumes all CPU cores when running, and deploying on a dedicated machine is highly recommended. If not possible, `tidb-lightning` could be deployed together with other components like `tidb-server`, and the CPU usage could be limited via the `region-concurrency` setting.

- `tikv-importer`:

    - 32+ logical cores CPU
    - 40 GB+ memory
    - 1 TB+ SSD, preferring higher IOPS (≥ 8000 is recommended)
        * The disk should be larger than the total size of the top N tables, where `N` = `max(index-concurrency, table-concurrency)`.
    - 10 Gigabit network card (capable of transferring at ≥300 MB/s)
    - `tikv-importer` fully consumes all CPU, disk I/O and network bandwidth when running, and deploying on a dedicated machine is strongly recommended.

If you have sufficient machines, you can deploy multiple `tidb lightning` + `tikv importer` servers, with each working on a distinct set of tables, to import the data in parallel.

#### Deploy TiDB Lightning manually

##### Step 1: Deploy a TiDB cluster

Before importing data, you need to have a deployed TiDB cluster, with the cluster version 2.0.9 or above. It is highly recommended to use the latest version.

You can find deployment instructions in [TiDB Quick Start Guide](/quick-start-with-tidb.md).

#### Step 2: Download the TiDB Lightning installation package

Refer to the [TiDB enterprise tools download page](/download-ecosystem-tools.md#tidb-lightning) to download the TiDB Lightning package (choose the same version as that of the TiDB cluster).

#### Step 3: Start `tikv-importer`

1. Upload `bin/tikv-importer` from the installation package.

2. Configure `tikv-importer.toml`.

    ```toml
    # TiKV Importer configuration file template

    # Log file
    log-file = "tikv-importer.log"
    # Log level: trace, debug, info, warn, error, off.
    log-level = "info"

    # Listening address of the status server.
    status-server-address = "0.0.0.0:8286"

    [server]
    # The listening address of tikv-importer. tidb-lightning needs to connect to
    # this address to write data.
    addr = "0.0.0.0:8287"

    [import]
    # The directory to store engine files.
    import-dir = "/mnt/ssd/data.import/"
    ```

    The above only shows the essential settings. See the [Configuration](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tikv-importer) section for the full list of settings.

3. Run `tikv-importer`.

    ```sh
    nohup ./tikv-importer -C tikv-importer.toml > nohup.out &
    ```

#### Step 4: Start `tidb-lightning`

1. Upload `bin/tidb-lightning` and `bin/tidb-lightning-ctl` from the tool set.

2. Mount the data source onto the same machine.

3. Configure `tidb-lightning.toml`. For configurations that do not appear in the template below, TiDB Lightning writes a configuration error to the log file and exits.

    ```toml
    [lightning]
    # The concurrency number of data. It is set to the number of logical CPU
    # cores by default. When deploying together with other components, you can
    # set it to 75% of the size of logical CPU cores to limit the CPU usage.
    # region-concurrency =

    # Logging
    level = "info"
    file = "tidb-lightning.log"

    [tikv-importer]
    # The listening address of tikv-importer. Change it to the actual address.
    addr = "172.16.31.10:8287"

    [mydumper]
    # mydumper local source data directory
    data-source-dir = "/data/my_database"

    [tidb]
    # Configuration of any TiDB server from the cluster
    host = "172.16.31.1"
    port = 4000
    user = "root"
    password = ""
    # Table schema information is fetched from TiDB via this status-port.
    status-port = 10080
    ```

    The above only shows the essential settings. See the [Configuration](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-global) section for the full list of settings.

4. Run `tidb-lightning`. If you directly run the command in the command-line, the process might exit because of the SIGHUP signal received. Instead, it's preferable to run a bash script that contains the `nohup` command:

    ```sh
    nohup ./tidb-lightning -config tidb-lightning.toml > nohup.out &
    ```
