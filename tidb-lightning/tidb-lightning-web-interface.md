# TiDB Lightning Web Interface

TiDB Lightning provides a webpage for viewing the import progress and performing some simple task management. This is called the *server mode*.

To enable server mode, either start `tidb-lightning` with the `--server-mode` flag

```sh
./tidb-lightning --server-mode --status-addr :8289
```

or set the `lightning.server-mode` setting in the configuration file.

```toml
[lightning]
server-mode = true
status-addr = ':8289'
```

After TiDB Lightning is launched, visit `http://127.0.0.1:8289` to control the program (the actual URL depends on the `status-addr` setting).

In server mode, TiDB Lightning does not start running immediately. Rather, users submit (multiple) *tasks* via the web interface to import data.

## Front page

![Front page of the web interface](/media/lightning-web-frontpage.png)

Functions of the title bar, from left to right:

| Icon | Function |
|:----|:----|
| "TiDB Lightning" | Click to go back to the front page |
| ⚠ | Display any error message from *previous* task |
| ⓘ | List current and queued tasks; a badge may appear here to indicate number of queued tasks |
| + | Submit a task |
| ⏸/▶ | Pause/resume current execution |
| ⟳ | Configure auto-refresh of the web page |

Three panels below the title bar show all tables in different states:

* Active: these tables are currently being imported
* Completed: these tables have been imported successfully or failed
* Pending: these tables are not yet processed

Each panel contains cards describing the status of the table.

## Submit task

Click the **+** button on the title bar to submit a task.

![Submit task dialog](/media/lightning-web-submit.png)

Tasks are TOML files described as [task configurations](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task).
One could also open a local TOML file by clicking **UPLOAD**.

Click **SUBMIT** to run the task.
If a task is already running, the new task will be queued and executed after the current task succeeds.

## Table progress

Click the **>** button of a table card on the front page to view the detailed progress of a table.

![Table progress](/media/lightning-web-table.png)

The page shows the import progress of every engine and data files associated with the table.

Click **TiDB Lightning** on the title bar to go back to the front page.

## Task management

Click the **ⓘ** button on the title bar to manage the current and queued tasks.

![Task management page](/media/lightning-web-queue.png)

Each task is labeled by the time it was submitted.
Clicking the task would show the configuration formatted as JSON.

Manage tasks by clicking the **⋮** button next to a task.
You can stop a task immediately, or reorder queued tasks.
