# TiDB Lightning Monitoring

Both `tidb-lightning` and `tikv-importer` supports metrics collection via [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/). This document introduces the monitor configuration and monitoring metrics of TiDB Lightning.

## Monitor configuration

- If TiDB Lightning is installed using TiDB Ansible, simply add the servers to the `[monitored_servers]` section in the `inventory.ini` file. Then the Prometheus server can collect their metrics.
- If TiDB Lightning is manually installed, follow the instructions below.

The metrics of `tidb-lightning` and `tikv-importer` can be gathered directly by Prometheus as long as it is discovered. You can set the metrics port in `tidb-lightning.toml`:

```toml
[lightning]
# HTTP port for debugging and Prometheus metrics pulling (0 to disable)
pprof-port = 8289

...
```

and in `tikv-importer.toml`:

```toml
# Listening address of the status server.
status-server-address = '0.0.0.0:8286'
```

You need to configure Prometheus to make it discover the servers. For instance, you can directly add the server address to the `scrape_configs` section:

```yaml
...
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'lightning'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['192.168.20.10:8289']
  - job_name: 'tikv-importer'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['192.168.20.9:8286']
```

## Grafana dashboard

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is a web interface to visualize Prometheus metrics as dashboards.

If TiDB Lightning is installed using TiDB Ansible, its dashboard is already installed.
Otherwise, the dashboard JSON can be imported from <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pingcap/tidb-ansible/master/scripts/lightning.json>.

### Row 1: Speed

![Panels in first row](/media/lightning-grafana-row-1.png)

| Panel | Series | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| Import speed | write from lightning | Speed of sending KVs from TiDB Lightning to TiKV Importer, which depends on each table's complexity |
| Import speed | upload to tikv | Total upload speed from TiKV Importer to all TiKV replicas |
| Chunk process duration | | Average time needed to completely encode one single data file |

Sometimes the import speed will drop to zero allowing other parts to catch up. This is normal.

### Row 2: Progress

![Panels in second row](/media/lightning-grafana-row-2.png)

| Panel | Description |
|:-----|:-----|
| Import progress | Percentage of data files encoded so far |
| Checksum progress | Percentage of tables are verified to be imported successfully |
| Failures | Number of failed tables and their point of failure, normally empty |

### Row 3: Resource

![Panels in third row](/media/lightning-grafana-row-3.png)

| Panel | Description |
|:-----|:-----|
| Memory usage | Amount of memory occupied by each service |
| Number of Lightning Goroutines | Number of running goroutines used by TiDB Lightning |
| CPU% | Number of logical CPU cores utilized by each service |

### Row 4: Quota

![Panels in fourth row](/media/lightning-grafana-row-4.png)

| Panel | Series | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| Idle workers | io | Number of unused `io-concurrency`, normally close to configured value (default 5), and close to 0 means the disk is too slow |
| Idle workers | closed-engine | Number of engines which is closed but not yet cleaned up, normally close to index + table-concurrency (default 8), and close to 0 means TiDB Lightning is faster than TiKV Importer, which will cause TiDB Lightning to stall |
| Idle workers | table | Number of unused `table-concurrency`, normally 0 until the end of process |
| Idle workers | index | Number of unused `index-concurrency`, normally 0 until the end of process |
| Idle workers | region | Number of unused `region-concurrency`, normally 0 until the end of process |
| External resources | KV Encoder | Counts active KV encoders, normally the same as `region-concurrency` until the end of process |
| External resources | Importer Engines | Counts opened engine files, should never exceed the `max-open-engines` setting |

### Row 5: Read speed

![Panels in fifth row](/media/lightning-grafana-row-5.png)

| Panel | Series | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| Chunk parser read block duration | read block | Time taken to read one block of bytes to prepare for parsing |
| Chunk parser read block duration | apply worker | Time elapsed to wait for an idle io-concurrency |
| SQL process duration | row encode | Time taken to parse and encode a single row |
| SQL process duration | block deliver | Time taken to send a block of KV pairs to TiKV Importer |

If any of the duration is too high, it indicates that the disk used by TiDB Lightning is too slow or busy with I/O.

### Row 6: Storage

![Panels in sixth row](/media/lightning-grafana-row-6.png)

| Panel | Series | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| SQL process rate | data deliver rate | Speed of delivery of data KV pairs to TiKV Importer |
| SQL process rate | index deliver rate | Speed of delivery of index KV pairs to TiKV Importer |
| SQL process rate | total deliver rate | The sum of two rates above |
| Total bytes | parser read size | Number of bytes being read by TiDB Lightning |
| Total bytes | data deliver size | Number of bytes of data KV pairs already delivered to TiKV Importer |
| Total bytes | index deliver size | Number of bytes of index KV pairs already delivered to TiKV Importer |
| Total bytes | storage_size / 3 | Total size occupied by the TiKV cluster, divided by 3 (the default number of replicas) |

### Row 7: Import speed

![Panels in seventh row](/media/lightning-grafana-row-7.png)

| Panel | Series | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| Delivery duration | Range delivery | Time taken to upload a range of KV pairs to the TiKV cluster |
| Delivery duration | SST delivery | Time taken to upload an SST file to the TiKV cluster |
| SST process duration | Split SST | Time taken to split the stream of KV pairs into SST files |
