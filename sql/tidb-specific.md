# TiDB Specific System Variables

TiDB contains a number of system variables which are specific to its usage, and **do not** apply to MySQL. These variables start with a `tidb_` prefix, and can be tuned to optimize system performance.

## System variables

Variables can be set with the `SET` statement, for example:

```
set @@tidb_distsql_scan_concurrency = 10
```

If you need to set the global variable, run:

```
set @@global.tidb_distsql_scan_concurrency = 10
```

### tidb_snapshot

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: ""
- This variable is used to set the time point at which the data is read by the session. For example, when you set the variable to "2017-11-11 20:20:20" or a TSO number like "400036290571534337", the current session reads the data of this moment.

### tidb_import_data

- If the memory quota of the `Sort` operator during execution exceeds the threshold value, TiDB performs the operation designated by the OOMAction option in the configuration file.

### tidb_mem_quota_topn

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 32 GB
- This variable is used to set the threshold value of memory quota for the `TopN` operator.

### tidb_mem_quota_indexlookupreader

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 32 GB

- If the memory quota of the `NestedLoopApply` operator during execution exceeds the threshold value, TiDB performs the operation designated by the OOMAction option in the configuration file.

### tidb_general_log

- Scope: SERVER
- Default value: 0
- This variable is used to set whether to record all the SQL statements in the log.

### tidb_enable_streaming

- Scope: SERVER
- Default value: 0
- This variable is used to set whether to enable Streaming.

### tidb_retry_limit

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 10
- When a transaction encounters retriable errors, such as transaction conflicts and TiKV busy, this transaction can be re-executed. This variable is used to set the maximum number of the retries.

### tidb_disable_txn_auto_retry

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default: 0
- This variable is used to set whether to disable automatic retry of explicit transactions. If you set this variable to 1, the transaction does not retry automatically. If there is a conflict, the transaction needs to be retried at the application layer. To decide whether you need to disable automatic retry, see [description of optimistic transactions](../sql/transaction-isolation.md#description-of-optimistic-transactions).

### tidb_enable_table_partition

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 0
- This variable is used to set whether to enable the `TABLE PARTITION` feature.

### tidb_backoff_lock_fast

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 100
- This variable is used to set the `backoff` time when the read request meets a lock.

### tidb_ddl_reorg_worker_cnt

- Scope: GLOBAL
- Default value: 16
- This variable is used to set the concurrency of the DDL operation in the `re-organize` phase.

### tidb_ddl_reorg_batch_size

- Scope: GLOBAL
- Default value: 1024
- This variable is used to set the batch size during the `re-organize` phase of the DDL operation. For example, when TiDB executes the `ADD INDEX` operation, the index data needs to backfilled by `tidb_ddl_reorg_worker_cnt` (the number) concurrent workers. Each worker backfills the index data in batches.
    - If many updating operations such as `UPDATE` and `REPLACE` exist during the `ADD INDEX` operation, a larger batch size indicates a larger probability of transaction conflicts. In this case, you need to adjust the batch size to a smaller value. The minimum value is 32.
    - If the transaction conflict does not exist, you can set the batch size to a large value. The maximum value is 10240. This can increase the speed of the backfilling data, but the write pressure on TiKV also becomes higher.

### tidb_ddl_reorg_priority

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: `PRIORITY_LOW`
- This variable is used to set the priority of executing the `ADD INDEX` operation in the `re-organize` phase.
- You can set the value of this variable to `PRIORITY_LOW`, `PRIORITY_NORMAL` or `PRIORITY_HIGH`.

### tidb_force_priority

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: `NO_PRIORITY`
- This variable is used to change the default priority for statements executed on a TiDB server. A use case is to ensure that a particular user that is performing OLAP queries receives lower priority than users performing OLTP queries.
- You can set the value of this variable to `NO_PRIORITY`, `LOW_PRIORITY`, `DELAYED` or `HIGH_PRIORITY`.

## Optimizer Hints

TiDB supports optimizer hints, based on the comment-like syntax introduced in MySQL 5.7. i.e. `/*+ TIDB_XX(t1, t2) */`. Use of optimizer hints is recommended in cases where the TiDB optimizer selects a less optimal query plan.

> **Note:** MySQL command-line clients earlier than 5.7.7 strip optimizer hints by default. If you want to use the `Hint` syntax in these earlier versions, add the `--comments` option when starting the client. For example: `mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 4000 -uroot --comments`.

### TIDB_SMJ(t1, t2)

```sql
SELECT /*+ TIDB_SMJ(t1, t2) */ * from t1, t2 where t1.id = t2.id
```

This variable is used to remind the optimizer to use the `Sort Merge Join` algorithm. This algorithm takes up less memory, but takes longer to execute. It is recommended if the data size is too large, or there’s insufficient system memory.

### TIDB_INLJ(t1, t2)

```sql
SELECT /*+ TIDB_INLJ(t1, t2) */ * from t1, t2 where t1.id = t2.id
```

This variable is used to remind the optimizer to use the `Index Nested Loop Join` algorithm. In some scenarios, this algorithm runs faster and takes up fewer system resources, but may be slower and takes up more system resources in some other scenarios. You can try to use this algorithm in scenarios where the result-set is less than 10,000 rows after the outer table is filtered by the WHERE condition. The parameter in `TIDB_INLJ()` is the candidate table for the inner table when you create the query plan. For example, `TIDB_INLJ (t1)` means that TiDB only considers using t1 as the inner table to create a query plan.

### TIDB_HJ(t1, t2)

```sql
SELECT /*+ TIDB_HJ(t1, t2) */ * from t1, t2 where t1.id = t2.id
```

This variable is used to remind the optimizer to use the `Hash Join` algorithm. This algorithm executes threads concurrently. It runs faster but takes up more memory.

## SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS

For the tables with non-integer PK or without PK, TiDB uses an implicit auto-increment ROW ID. When a large number of `INSERT` operations occur, the data is written into a single Region, causing a write hot spot.

To mitigate the hot spot issue, you can configure `SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS`. The ROW ID is scattered and the data is written into multiple different Regions. But setting an overlarge value might lead to an excessively large number of RPC requests, which increases the CPU and network overheads.

- `SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS = 4` indicates 16 shards
- `SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS = 6` indicates 64 shards
- `SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS = 0` indicates the default 1 shard

Usage of statements:

- `CREATE TABLE`: `CREATE TABLE t (c int) SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS = 4;`
- `ALTER TABLE`: `ALTER TABLE t SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS = 4;`

## tidb_slow_log_threshold

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 300ms
- This variable is used to output the threshold value of the time consumed by the slow log. When the time consumed by a query is larger than this value, this query is considered as a slow log and its log is output to the slow query log.

Usage example:

```sql
set tidb_slow_log_threshold = 200
```

## tidb_query_log_max_len

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 2048 (bytes)
- The maximum length of the SQL statement output. When the output length of a statement is larger than the `tidb_query-log-max-len` value, the statement is truncated to output.

Usage example:

```sql
set tidb_query_log_max_len = 20
```
