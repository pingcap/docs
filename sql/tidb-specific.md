# The Proprietary System Variables and Syntaxes in TiDB

On the basis of MySQL variables and syntaxes, TiDB has defined some specific system variables and syntaxes to optimize performance.

## System variable
Variables can be set with the `SET` statement, for example:

```set @@tidb_distsql_scan_concurrency = 10 ```

If you need to set the global variable, run:

```set @@global.tidb_distsql_scan_concurrency = 10 ```
 
### tidb_snapshot

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: ""
- This variable is used to set the time point at which the data is read by the session. For example, when you set the variable to "2017-11-11 20:20:20", the current session reads the data of this moment.

### tidb_import_data

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAl
- Default value: 0
- This variable indicates whether to import data from the dump file currently.
- To speed up importing, the unique index constraint is not checked when the variable is set to 1.
- This variable is only used by Lightning. Do not modify it.  

### tidb_opt_agg_push_down

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 0
- This variable is used to set whether the optimizer executes the optimization operation of pushing down the aggregate function to the position before Join.
- When the aggregate operation is slow in query, you can set the variable value to 1.

### tidb_opt_insubquery_unfold

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 0
- This variable is used to set whether the optimizer executes the optimization operation of unfolding the "in-" subquery.

### tidb_build_stats_concurrency

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 4
- This variable is used to set the concurrency of executing the `ANALYZE` statement.
- When the variable is set to a larger value, the execution performance of other queries is affected.

### tidb_checksum_table_concurrency

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 4
- This variable is used to set the scan index concurrency of executing the `ADMIN CHECKSUM TABLE` statement.
- When the variable is set to a larger value, the execution performance of other queries is affected.

### tidb_current_ts

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 0
- This variable is read-only. It is used to obtain the timestamp of the current transaction.

### tidb_skip_utf8_check

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 0
- This variable is used to set whether to skip UTF-8 validation.
- Validating UTF-8 characters affects the performance. When you are sure that the input characters are valid UTF-8 characters, you can set the variable value to 1.

### tidb_batch_insert

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 0
- This variable is used to set whether to divide the inserted data automatically.
- When inserting a large amount of data, you can set the variable value to true. Then the inserted data is automatically divided into multiple batches and each batch is inserted by a single transaction.

## Optimizer hint
On the basis of MySQL’s `Optimizer Hint` Syntax, TiDB adds some proprietary `Hint` syntaxes. When using the `Hint` syntax, the TiDB optimizer will try to use the specific algorithm, which performs better than the default algorithm in some scenarios.
 
The `Hint` syntax is included in comments like `/*+ xxx */`, and in MySQL client versions earlier than 5.7.7, the comment is removed by default. If you want to use the `Hint` syntax in these earlier versions, add the `--comments` option when starting the client. For example: `mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 4000 -uroot --comments`.
 
### TIDB_SMJ(t1, t2)
 
```SELECT /*+ TIDB_SMJ(t1, t2) */ * from t1，t2 where t1.id = t2.id```

This variable is used to remind the optimizer to use the `Sort Merge Join` algorithm. This algorithm takes up less memory, but takes longer to execute. It is recommended if the data size is too large, or there’s insufficient system memory.

### TIDB_INLJ(t1, t2)
 
```SELECT /*+ TIDB_INLJ(t1, t2) */ * from t1，t2 where t1.id = t2.id```

This variable is used to remind the optimizer to use the `Index Nested Loop Join` algorithm. In some scenarios, this algorithm runs faster and takes up fewer system resources, but may be slower and takes up more system resources in some other scenarios. You can try to use this algorithm in scenarios where the result-set is less than 10,000 rows after the outer table is filtered by the WHERE condition. The parameter in `TIDB_INLJ()` is the candidate table for the driving table (external table) when generating the query plan. That means, `TIDB_INLJ (t1)` will only consider using t1 as the driving table to create a query plan.

### TIDB_HJ(t1, t2)

```SELECT /*+ TIDB_HJ(t1, t2) */ * from t1，t2 where t1.id = t2.id```

This variable is used to remind the optimizer to use the `Hash Join` algorithm. This algorithm executes threads concurrently. It runs faster but takes up more memory.

## _tidb_rowid

This is a hidden column of TiDB, which represents the column name of the implicit ROW ID. It only exists on the tables with non-integer PK or without PK. You can execute the `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements on this column, and the usage of these statements are as follows:

- `SELECT`: `SELECT *, _tidb_rowid from t;`
- `INSERT`: `INSERT t (c, _tidb_rowid) VALUES (1, 1);`
- `UPDATE`: `UPDATE t SET c = c + 1 WHERE _tidb_rowid = 1;`
- `DELETE`: `DELETE FROM t WHERE _tidb_rowid = 1;`

## SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS

You can use this TABLE OPTION to set the bit digit of the number of implicit `_tidb_rowid` shards.

For the tables with non-integer PK or without PK, TiDB uses an implicit auto-increment ROW ID. When a large number of `INSERT` operations occur, the data is written into a single Region, causing a write hot spot.

To mitigate the hot spot issue, you can configure `SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS`. The ROW ID is scattered and the data is written into multiple different Regions. But setting an overlarge value might lead to an excessively large number of RPC requests, which increases the CPU and network overheads.

- `SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS = 4` indicates 16 shards
- `SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS = 6` indicates 64 shards
- `SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS = 0` indicates the default 1 shard

Usage of statements:

- `CREATE TABLE`: `CREATE TABLE t (c int) SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS = 4;`
- `ALTER TABLE`: `ALTER TABLE MODIFY t SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS = 4;`
